Achilles Tendonitis,https://ada.com/conditions/achilles-tendonitis/,,"The most common symptom of Achilles tendonitis is pain in the back of the foot and heel. The onset of pain may be sudden or gradual.[2]Symptoms of Achilles tendonitis include:[3][4]Pain at the back of the foot and heel when moving the ankle
Pain when pointing the toes, or pushing off from the toes
Pain which becomes worse after exercising
Stiffness along the back of the foot and heel, especially with the first steps in the morning
Swelling and tenderness in the back of the foot and heel
Thickening of the tendon
Bone spurs in cases of insertional tendonitis (see Insertional Achilles tendonitis, below)","The Achilles tendon is a large, thick tendon that attaches the calf muscles to the bony heel of the foot. This tendon bears the weight of the body when pushing off from the toes in the act of walking or running.Achilles tendonitis most often occurs when the tendon becomes inflamed or damaged through overuse. Risk factors for developing Achilles tendonitis are:[3][4][5]Suddenly increasing the amount or intensity of exercise
Not stretching out the calf muscles properly after exercise
Running or exercising to excess
Running on hard surfaces
Jumping repeatedly during exercise or sports
Manual labour which puts stress on ankles and feet
Having bone spurs (osteophytes) which rub against the Achilles tendon
Not wearing sufficiently supportive shoes for exercise
Having flattened arches in the footAlthough Achilles tendonitis is commonly referred to as tendonitis, the condition does not always involve inflammation of the tendon. Over time, tendons ‒ including the Achilles tendon ‒ degenerate. When this happens, they become damaged and lose elasticity. Pain which is caused by this progressive degeneration is called Achilles tendinosis, or sometimes Achilles tendinopathy; however tendinopathy is technically an umbrella term for tendonitis and tendinosis.[5]Noninsertional Achilles tendonitis55 to 65 percent of Achilles tendonitis cases are classified as noninsertional Achilles tendonitis: the fibers in the center of the Achilles tendon begin to degenerate or become inflamed, swell and become thicker.[4][6]Insertional Achilles tendonitisInsertional Achilles tendonitis occurs when the Achilles tendon degenerates or gets inflamed at the point where the tendon attaches, or inserts, to the heel bone. Bone spurs, projections that develop along bone edges, also known as osteophytes may form in cases of insertional Achilles tendonitis.[4][7]Achilles tendon ruptureA complication of Achilles tendonitis can be an Achilles tendon rupture. A rupture occurs when a tendon tears, partially or completely, after being stretched beyond its capacity. Achilles tendonitis can increase the chances of a rupture occurring.[8][9]Around 80 percent of Achilles tendon ruptures occur during exercise and while playing sports. People most commonly develop the condition between the ages of 30 and 50.[1]The antibiotic class fluoroquinolones which, among many others, includes ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, may cause Achilles tendon rupture, even after a short course. Corticosteroid injections into the heel can also increase a person’s risk of developing Achilles tendon rupture.[10][11][7]","Achilles tendonitis can usually be diagnosed based on the symptoms, following a physical examination of the ankle and tendon. Other tests may be needed in more serious cases of Achilles tendonitis to establish the extent of the problem. These may include:[3][4]X-ray, which does not produce images of tendons but can reveal hardening (calcification) of tendons, as well as bone spurs
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which uses magnets and radio waves to look inside the body to produce detailed images of tendons, muscles and other soft tissue and may be of use when planning surgery","Most people with Achilles tendonitis will be treated with non-surgical options.Rest is vital to allow the Achilles tendon to heal. Any exercise or activity that causes pain should be stopped until the pain subsides. Depending on the severity of the tendonitis, this could take six months or longer. In severe cases, an immobilization boot may be necessary for a few weeks to reduce stress on the foot. An immobilization boot, also known as a walking boot or walking cast, is a removable alternative to a plaster cast, often used to aid healing after fracturing a bone or bone surgery. A splint worn at night has also been shown to temporarily reduce pain.[4][5][12]Physical therapy and exercises are recommended to help strengthen the calf muscles, which reduces stress on the Achilles tendon. Training programmes that focus on a particular type of muscle exercise, known as eccentric training, have been shown to help particularly well in cases of tendonitis. A common exercise is standing on a step and slowly lowering the heel, though a physical therapist can advise on the most appropriate exercises and demonstrate how to perform them. 60 to 90 percent of people who use eccentric exercises to strengthen their Achilles tendon report pain relief.[4][12][13][14]Ice, in the form of ice in a bag or an ice pack, can be applied to the affected area which may help reduce swelling. However, recent studies suggest ice may be more effective at treating inflammatory conditions such as paratenonitis, a condition where the tendon sheath around a tendon becomes inflamed, than tendonitis itself.[3][5][14]Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can also help provide pain relief. If the tendon is not inflamed, painkillers such as paracetamol may be  effective at relieving pain, too. NSAIDs should not be taken for long periods of time, as this can result in the development of side effects, such as stomach upsets and damage to the tissue of the gastrointestinal system. If needed, doctors can recommend appropriate painkillers for long-term use.[4][15]Studies have shown that glycerol trinitrate ointment, applied daily as a patch for six months, reduces pain and can help improve outcomes for people with Achilles tendonitis.[12]Shock-wave therapy is a procedure that increases blood flow to an injured area, speeding up the healing process by using a device to pass low-energy sound waves into the body. Studies have shown the treatment to be promising for treating Achilles tendonitis.[14][16]If Achilles tendonitis injuries take a long time to heal, a treatment where the person’s blood is taken from the arm vein and separated to extract platelet-rich plasma, which is then injected back into the tendon site, may be an option. However, while the evidence suggests few harmful side effects, there is still discussion around the treatment’s effectiveness.[13]Good to know: Corticosteroid injections may help to reduce inflammation and pain on a short term basis, but are not generally recommended for Achilles tendonitis, because they make the tendon more likely to rupture, especially if multiple, recurrent injections are given.[7]Surgical treatments for Achilles tendonitisWhere Achilles tendonitis fails to respond to non-surgical methods after six months, surgery may be necessary. There are a number of surgical procedures available, depending on the nature and location of the injury. A surgeon will recommend the best option. Possible procedures include:[4][17]Debridement and repair, which removes damaged parts of the tendon. This may be performed if less than 50 percent of the tendon is damaged
Debridement with tendon transfer may be performed when more than 50 percent of the tendon is damaged. The remaining tendon is supported with other tendon tissue, often taken from the long tendon of the big toe
Gastrocnemius recession, which lengthens the calf muscle to place less stress on the Achilles tendon
Bone spur removal, in cases of insertional tendonitis. Artificial anchors may be implanted to attach the tendon to the bone","There are a number of ways to help prevent Achilles tendonitis:[5]Taking care to warm up the body gently but properly, with light exercise before running or sprinting, such as brisk walking for a few minutes
Gradually increase the duration and intensity of exercise
Cool down after exercise, such as by changing to (brisk) walking for a few minutes after running or sprinting
Stretching fully after exercising
Strengthen calf muscles to reduce stress on the Achilles tendon
Use supportive footwear while exercising or playing sportsIf pain does occur, it is wise to rest the foot until receiving a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan to prevent a more severe injury developing. If a person experiences Achilles pain for the first time or it persists, they should seek medical treatment.","Q: Can Achilles tendonitis cause foot pain?
A: Yes. Achilles tendonitis causes pain in the back of the foot and the heel. See the section on Symptoms of Achilles tendonitis."
Acne Vulgaris,https://ada.com/conditions/acne-vulgaris/,,"Typical symptoms of acne include skin pimples, cysts and nodules. The pimples are often on the face, although the shoulders, back, chest and other body parts can also be affected. The skin around and over these pimples is sometimes red and sore. With time, the affected skin may become darker or scarred.Types of pimplesThere are six main types of pimples:[2]Blackheads: Small black or yellowish bumps.
Whiteheads:Small white or yellowish bumps, usually firmer than blackheads.
Papules: Small red bumps that can be sore.
Pustules: Similar to papules but will have a white spot in the center caused by a buildup of pus.
Nodules: Large hard bumps that are typically painful.
Cysts: Large lumps, similar to boils, filled with pus that may be painful. A severe form of acne that may cause scarring.","Pimples occur when dead skin cells and oil clog the pores of the skin. As more oil builds up behind the blockage, the pore becomes inflamed, and the pimple becomes painful and swollen. Acne typically appears for the first time during adolescence, triggered by the hormones (androgens) which begin to circulate in the body during puberty.Acne will often improve in early adulthood, but can persist longer. The condition affects teenage boys more often than girls, but, in adults, women develop it more commonly than men. There are a number of triggers that can make the development of acne more likely, including:[1]The use of the progesterone-only contraceptive pill
The hormonal changes triggered by menstrual periods
Some types of makeup
Picking or squeezing existing pimples
Sweating heavily
Humid weather
Tight clothing, headbands or collars, for example
Some medicines. Do not stop taking medication which is causing acne before talking to a doctor
Steroids, including anabolic steroids and steroid creams used to treat eczemaGenetics may also play a role in the development of acne; a person’s family history is relevant when visiting a dermatologist.","A doctor or dermatologist will diagnose acne following a skin examination, taking note of where the acne is located and its severity. These factors are important in determining how the condition should be treated.Professionals typically use a grading system to categorize acne:[2]Grade 1: Mild acne, probably limited to blackheads and whiteheads.
Grade 2: Moderate acne with papules and pustules, mostly confined to the face.
Grade 3: Moderately severe acne affecting the face, back and chest. Papules and pustules will be present, and inflamed nodules are possible.
Grade 4: Severe acne, with a large number of painful papules, pustules and nodules.","The treatment of acne depends on the severity of the condition. To treat very mild acne, simple steps such as washing the face and hair regularly, but not excessively, to remove excess oil, avoiding heavy, oily creams and cosmetics and maintaining a healthy diet may suffice.If, however, the acne is severe, or mild acne does not improve after following the steps outlined above, a number of different topical and/or oral medications are available. Some are available over the counter whereas others may require a prescription.Some of the most common topical acne medications include:[1][3]Retinoids: These medications are effective at unblocking pores and can help to reduce inflammation. They are often used early on in the treatment process and generally require a prescription. Types include adapalene, tretinoin and isotretinoin, which all come with various brand names.
Benzoyl peroxide: This is a topical treatment option which can be bought from pharmacies without a prescription. It is effective at clearing the skin of bacteria, unblocking pores and reducing inflammation. In some instances, this type of medication may be used in combination with antibiotics, which will typically require a prescription. Always read the enclosed information leaflet carefully before beginning treatment.
Topical antibiotics: These medications work by killing the bacteria growing inside the pores. They are therefore effective at reducing inflammation, but have limited effectiveness at unblocking pores, meaning they are generally ineffective at tackling blackheads or whiteheads. A prescription is necessary.
Selective aldosterone antagonists: Can be taken orally or applied topically. Examples include spironolactone.Some of the most common oral acne medications include:Antibiotics are effective at reducing inflammation and killing the bacteria that can contribute to acne. Tetracycline-based antibiotics are the most commonly prescribed for treating acne.
The combined pill (estrogen and progesterone, or substitutes) may be effective at treating acne in women whose acne seems to caused by abrupt hormonal changes.
Isotretinoin, part of the retinoids group, can be very effective at treating even severe acne, though is generally only used once all other treatment options have been explored. This is due to the teratogen risk and possible side-effects that isotretinoin may cause, which include headaches, joint and muscle pain.Acne treatment can take a number of weeks to show results, with most showing good results by roughly week six. It is therefore important to continue treatment, even if the acne is showing no signs of improvement.",[],"Q: Will acne return after treatment?
A: Once treatment has been stopped, it is normal for acne to return. For this reason, many people choose to carry on with maintenance treatment, sometimes for as long as four or five years. This is usually done using a topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide.[1]Q: Can acne ever pose a serious risk to your health?
A: Acne does not pose a direct health risk, but can, in some cases, cause permanent scarring of the skin. If your acne does not respond to treatment, you may be referred to a hospital specialist to explore further options. If scarring has already occurred, laser treatment or a chemical peel, among other options, may be recommended.[1]"
Acute Appendicitis,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-appendicitis/,,"The signs and symptoms of appendicitis appear quickly, usually starting with abdominal
(stomach) pain. As acute appendicitis can lead to a burst appendix within 24 to 72 hours,
it is important to seek medical attention as soon as symptoms begin to appear. The most
common initial symptoms include:[2]Pain in the upper abdomen or near the navel, starting dull and becoming sharper as it
moves to the lower right-hand side (this location is most common, but pain can also occur
in other parts of the abdomen)
Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting[3]Other common symptoms include:Fever and chills
Difficulty urinating
Difficulty passing gas
Constipation, diarrhea or alternating periods of both
Swollen belly
Severe crampsSymptoms of a burst appendix include intense abdominal pain in the lower right side that
decreases and becomes generalized abdominal pain, accompanied by a high fever.[4]A person experiencing symptoms of appendicitis should seek medical attention and avoid taking
over-the-counter painkillers or other medications, which could mask the symptoms and make
it more difficult to diagnose. They should also avoid eating or drinking, as well as the
use of home remedies such as heating pads, laxatives or enemas, as these can cause the
appendix to burst. People experiencing possible symptoms of acute appendicitis can also use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.Acute appendicitis symptoms in children and adolescentsChildren are most likely to get appendicitis between the ages of 8 and 16.[5] Young children
with acute appendicitis may have difficulty describing the symptoms they are experiencing,
so it is important that parents are aware of the signs of appendicitis. For example, even
if a child is experiencing localized pain on the right side of their abdomen, they might
identify the pain as affecting their entire stomach, leading parents to think their child
has a different condition.[6]The most common symptoms of acute appendicitis in children are:Abdominal pain and pain with movement
Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting
FeverIn older children and teenagers, the most common symptoms are similar to those experienced
by adults.It is not uncommon for acute appendicitis in children to be confused with stomach flu, a
misdiagnosis which increases the risk of a burst appendix.Acute appendicitis symptoms in pregnancyIdentifying appendicitis in pregnant women can be difficult, as many of the symptoms are
similar to the discomfort normally associated with pregnancy, such as nausea, vomiting and
cramping. The appendix may also be pushed by the uterus into the upper abdomen by a few
centimeters, particularly during the third trimester. In this case, pain from appendicitis
may occur in the upper right side, instead of only its usual position in the
lower right side.Women in the later stages of pregnancy are difficult to diagnose with appendicitis because
they tend to have unusual symptoms. These can include a sudden change in bowel habits
(constipation and diarrhea), an increase in gas, and new or worsening heartburn.[7] Pregnancy women experiencing possible symptoms of acute appendicitis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.","Appendicitis is generally caused by a blockage of the appendix, which increases the pressure
inside the appendix and cuts off blood flow. Inside the blocked appendix, bacteria multiply
and form pus, which further damages the wall of the appendix and causes pain and irritation.
The blockage is most often caused by hardened stool, but can also be caused by tumors, scar
tissue or swollen lymph nodes.[8]","Acute appendicitis symptoms are similar to those of other conditions, such as a urinary tract
infection (UTI), bladder infection, Crohn’s disease, gallbladder issues, intestinal infection,
diverticulitis of the cecum or gastritis. To make a clear diagnosis, doctors will typically
use a range of tests.Tests used in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis include:Physical examination of the abdomen
Rectal exam
Blood tests for signs of infection (such as a white blood cell count)
CT scan
MRI
Abdominal ultrasonography
Urine test (to exclude a UTI as the cause)[10]","An appendectomy (surgery to remove the appendix), also known as an appendicectomy outside the US, is the chosen treatment method for acute appendicitis in almost all cases, as the risk of an infected appendix rupturing and causing a life-threatening infection is extremely high.[11]Recent evidence has suggested that some cases of uncomplicated appendicitis can be treated
with antibiotics instead of an appendectomy. However, this is only appropriate when the
appendix has not burst or caused an abscess. An appendectomy remains the standard treatment for appendicitis.[12]",[],"Q: How can I tell if it’s appendicitis or something less serious?
A: In some ways, the abdominal pain and nausea from appendicitis can feel similar to
the discomfort caused by gas, constipation, indigestion or stomach flu. However, the pain
caused by appendicitis is usually localized to the lower right side of the abdomen, far
more severe and tends to increase in intensity.Pressing on the abdominal area will increase the pain from acute appendicitis, as will passing gas
or belching. Acute appendicitis also usually occurs with a high fever.[13]As acute appendicitis can progress from the first signs to rupture in 24-72 hours, it
is important to visit a hospital as soon as acute appendicitis is suspected. Signs may include fever or digestive upset, combined with abdominal pain on the right side of the abdomen that becomes more intense instead of abating. Sometimes the symptoms of appendicitis do not follow a predictable pattern, though, so a person experiencing unusual abdominal pain that lasts for longer than four hours should seek a diagnosis from a doctor urgently, especially if any other symptoms are also present.Q: Is there always a fever with appendicitis?
A: Acute appendicitis sometimes occurs without a fever.Q: How can appendicitis be prevented?
A: There is no known way to prevent appendicitis, but it does seem to occur less commonly
among people who eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and fiber.[14]Q: Are there any risks associated with an appendectomy (appendicectomy)?
A: An appendectomy – the surgical procedure to remove the appendix – is generally considered routine. However, there are certain risks associated with an appendectomy, just as there is with any surgical procedure. These risks include excessive bleeding, infection, the formation of an abscess and abdominal inflammation. Before undergoing an appendectomy, be sure to discuss the possible complications with your doctor.[1]Q: What happens if my appendix bursts?
A: As soon as the warning signs of appendicitis appear (abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, etc) it is important to seek emergency medical attention to ensure the appropriate treatment is received. If this does not happen and the appendix bursts, potentially life threatening infections can result. If bacteria from a burst appendix reaches the peritoneum (the inner lining of the belly), this can result in an infection known as peritonitis. Signs of peritonitis include severe continuous abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, vomiting and fever. Another possible consequence of a burst appendix is the formation of an abscess. Both peritonitis and an abscess can be treated with antibiotics (most likely administered intravenously) but require urgent medical attention.[15]"
Acute Aspiration of Oropharyngeal or Gastric Contents,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-aspiration-of-oropharyngeal-or-gastric-contents/,,"Symptoms may include a cough with eating, choking, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing, extreme tiredness, fever, and a blue tinge to the lips, fingers and feet.",[],"The diagnosis is based on the symptoms, a physical examination and a chest X-ray or CT scan. Other tests that may be useful include tests of swallowing function and testing the airway mucus for bacteria.","Treatment depends on the severity of the aspiration. The aspirated objects or objects may need to removed by using a flexible camera to look at the windpipes. If pneumonia occurs, antibiotics might be given. In severe cases, the aspiration may cause severe damage to the lungs, and a machine to help with breathing (a ventilator) might be necessary to support breathing while the lungs recover.","Most people can prevent it by having a strong cough. Physiotherapy can help to develop and maintain the coughing muscles. People with difficulty swallowing should get and follow advice from a speech pathologist on foods that are safe to eat to prevent aspiration. Avoiding some behaviors, such as excessive drinking and talking when eating, may help avoid some episodes of aspiration.",[]
Acute Bronchitis,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-bronchitis/,,"The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is a cough, which is typically described as dry and hacking in nature in its initial stages. As the condition develops and mucus is built up in the lungs, coughing up mucus will likely occur. This mucus may be yellow, green or clear in colour. The cough generally lasts for around two to three weeks, but can last for longer.[3]Other symptoms of acute bronchitis include:[4]Sore throat
Fever
Chest congestion
Shortness of breath
Wheezing
Chills
FatigueWhen experiencing a very high fever, persistent chills, shoulder and neck pain or if symptoms generally worsen, it is important to seek medical attention. In some cases, acute bronchitis may develop into pneumonia, a more serious condition.[5]","Acute bronchitis is most commonly caused by a virus – often the same viruses that cause upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold and flu. The condition can be contracted through exposure to droplets released after an infected person coughs or sneezes, with most viruses able to survive on a surface for as long as 24 hours.[6] Acute bronchitis can also be caused by bacteria, but this is far less common.","In its early stages, it may be difficult to distinguish acute bronchitis from a common cold. However, in the majority of cases, a doctor will be able to diagnose acute bronchitis after performing a physical examination and inquiring about what symptoms are being experienced.If there are difficulties in diagnosing acute bronchitis, or if the condition persists for a longer period than expected, a series of further tests may be called for:[7]Pulmonary function test: Used to check for signs of asthma or emphysema.
Sputum tests: Sputum, or mucus, can be tested to identify its underlying causes.
Chest X-ray: An X-ray may be useful in determining the cause of a cough and ruling out the possibility of pneumonia, whooping cough or other lung problems.","In many cases, acute bronchitis will require no treatment and will clear up of its own accord in two to three weeks. If the condition is particularly severe, if it lasts for longer than the norm or if a bacterial cause is suspected, however, treatment methods are available. These include:[8]Cough medicine: If a cough is particularly severe and affects sleep, a cough medicine may be prescribed by a doctor, or they may recommend an over-the-counter (OTC) form of cough medicine. Pain relievers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol can be taken to suppress pain.
Other medications: People with allergies, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be prescribed a range of other medications to alleviate the symptoms of the condition.To manage the symptoms of acute bronchitis at home, individuals are also recommended to:[9]Rest: Rest is vital in order to help the immune system regain its strength.
Hydrate: Drinking plenty of water helps thin out the mucus in the chest, making it easier to cough up.
Consume hot drinks and lozenges: Drinks such as tea with honey and over-the-counter lozenges can provide some relief from certain symptoms.
Inhale steam: Steam from a hot shower or towel can help dislodge mucus and relieve symptoms.There are many natural products which can effectively help alleviate the symptoms of a chest cold. These include:Apple cider vinegar: Raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar helps thin the mucus in the chest, which can reduce congestion and help a person with a chest cold to breathe better. Drinking a solution of warm water mixed with two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar, two or three times a day for a week will help reduce the duration of a chest cold and strengthen the immune system, preventing future colds.
Turmeric: Tumeric, a plant and spice that grows in Southeast-Asian and Middle-Eastern countries, is very effective at reducing the symptoms of a chest cold. It contains the compound curcumin, which has antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Adding one teaspoon of fresh and grated turmeric, or powdered turmeric, to a hot drink several times a day or using it to flavour food can help alleviate the symptoms of a chest cold.
Ginger: Ginger has been used as a natural remedy to treat various conditions for over 2000 years and is an effective agent in reducing the inflammation in the chest caused by a chest cold. It can be added to food in its raw state, brewed as a tea or taken as supplements.
Essential oils: There are many different types of essential oils, each of which are particularly helpful with alleviating the symptoms of a different array of conditions. The most helpful essential oils for treating a chest cold include frankincense, oregano, eucalyptus, tea tree and lemon. Essential oils can be added to a hot compress, bath water, dabbed on the neck and temples or administered using a vaporiser/diffuser. When using essential oils to treat a chest cold, always consult the instructions on the packaging for the most appropriate way to apply them.Some herbal remedies and supplements are not compatible with underlying conditions or prescription medications. If, in addition to their chest cold, a person has a chronic (ongoing) condition and/or regularly takes any medications, they should consult their doctor before using any new natural products.","Although it is not always possible to completely avoid the viruses and bacteria that cause acute bronchitis, there are several ways to reduce the risk of getting acute bronchitis from them. These include:[10]Washing hands as frequently and thoroughly as possible
Get plenty of rest
Avoid excessively touching the eyes or mouth, particularly around people with acute bronchitis
Avoid sharing things such as drinking glasses or utensils
Stay healthy with regular exercise and a balanced diet
Get vaccines for pneumonia, flu and whooping cough","Q: Is acute bronchitis contagious?
A: Yes, acute bronchitis is contagious. It is, in most cases, spread by influenza or other similar virus types. These viruses can be spread from person to person via droplets produced when an infected individual sneezes, coughs or talks. To avoid developing acute bronchitis, people should wash their hands regularly, avoid contact with infected individuals and get an annual flu shot.[13]Q: Are there any home remedies for acute bronchitis?
A: Yes, there are a number of home remedies for acute bronchitis. Such remedies are recommended to help aid the recovery from the condition, though, if symptoms persist, professional medical attention should always be sought. Home remedies include:[14]Rest: Rest is key to helping the immune system recover its strength.
Herbal remedies: A variety of natural products, including drinking ginger tea and/or sage tea, can be helpful in alleviating acute bronchitis, due to their anti-inflammatory and decongesting properties.
Water: Staying well-hydrated helps thin the mucus produced as a result of acute bronchitis, meaning it is easier to expel.
Salt: Gargling with salt water may help clean away excess mucus.
Spicy food: Spicy food can help dislodge mucus and clear up the airways.Q: Can antibiotics be used to treat acute bronchitis?
A: As acute bronchitis is usually the result of a viral infection, it is not recommended that antibiotics be used to treat the condition. Most cases of acute bronchitis clear up of their own accord or only require pain relievers or cough medication. Unnecessary use of antibiotics can be harmful and lead to antibiotic resistance.[15]Q: What is the difference between acute bronchitis and a chest cold?
A: There is no difference between acute bronchitis and a chest cold – they are different terms for the same condition. Acute bronchitis, however, is different to a common cold and is  characterized by its more severe symptoms and the buildup of mucus.[16]"
Acute Gastritis,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-gastritis/,,"Symptoms of acute gastritis can include recurring nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, a feeling of burning in the stomach and passing melena, a stool containing blood related to upper gastrointestinal bleeding; this will appear to be black and tarry.[6]Some people also experience a feeling of fullness in the upper part of the stomach or abdomen, become full too quickly after eating, or vomit blood, which may resemble coffee grounds. Acute gastritis may occur with or without bleeding. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.While many cases of acute gastritis can be managed effectively at home, a doctor should be asked to address symptoms lasting for longer than one week, pain that awakens a person from sleep or the appearance of blood in vomit or stool.[7]","When the protective layer of mucus in the stomach is damaged, gastric acids can irritate the stomach lining. The mucus layer is often damaged by repeated use of NSAID drugs such as aspirin and excessive consumption of alcohol. H. pylori, the bacteria that causes peptic ulcers, can also cause acute gastritis, though many people have H. pylori in their stomach without experiencing gastritis symptoms. Other causes may include traumatic injury, burns or major surgery.Though less common, acute gastritis can also be caused by digestive issues such as Crohn’s disease, viral infections, extreme stress, kidney failure or bile reflux.[3] However, gastritis caused by autoimmune conditions, such as Crohn’s disease, tends to be chronic (long-lasting), rather than acute.","To assist with the diagnosis of acute gastritis, a doctor will assess a patient’s lifestyle, including their use of medications such as aspirin, NSAIDs and antacids, as well as alcohol consumption. They will also conduct a physical examination of the abdomen. Depending on these factors, a number of tests may be used for a diagnosis:Blood test for anemia
Stool test for the presence of blood
Testing for H. pylori: These tests may include a blood, stool or breath test.
EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy), also called gastroscopy or upper endoscopy: An EGD is a visual inspection of the stomach lining, performed by passing an endoscope – a long, thin, flexible tube with a lighted camera – down the throat and into the esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. The doctor can examine the stomach lining for signs of inflammation and take a small tissue sample (biopsy) for further testing. The biopsy is an additional method to test for H. pylori.[8] An EGD is more likely to be used if other test results are unusual, or if the patient is experiencing extreme fatigue and weight loss.
Upper gastrointestinal (GI) series: Also called a barium swallow, this test creates a series of X-rays of the GI tract. Swallowing a liquid containing barium coats the inside of the stomach, esophagus and small intestine to make the organs, as well as an ulcer or other abnormality, more visible by X-ray.","The treatment of acute gastritis varies according to the cause of the irritation, and a doctor will design a treatment taking into account factors such as the patient’s age, overall health, seriousness of the symptoms and the cause of the inflammation.[9] Most cases of acute gastritis resolve themselves in a few days or weeks, typically through adjustment of diet and removal of irritating substances, but both over-the-counter and prescription medications may also be used.Acute gastritis diet and home remediesPeople with acute gastritis should avoid irritant pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or aspirin. Patients who drink alcohol or smoke will be advised to stop. After the gastritis heals, they may be able to resume drinking small amounts of alcohol.It is also advisable to stop eating things that irritate the stomach, such as fatty, spicy or highly acidic foods. Some people choose to reduce foods containing lactose or gluten.Other lifestyle changes that may help include eating smaller, more frequent meals rather than larger meals, weight reduction and managing stress. Some research suggests that herbal supplements including clove, slippery elm, licorice, wild indigo and myrrh can improve digestive health and mitigate H. pylori.[10]Most minor cases of acute gastritis will respond to these treatments within a few days, with no need for further medication.Acute gastritis medicationsPatients may use over-the-counter antacids (TUMS, milk of magnesia and Pepto-Bismol) to neutralize acid and reduce pain. Side effects can include constipation and diarrhea.Prescription medications that can treat acute gastritis include histamine (H2) blockers, such as famotidine [Pepcid] and cimetidine [Tagamet], as well as proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole (Prilosec) and esomeprazole (Nexium).[11]If H. pylori infection is a cause of the acute gastritis, antibiotics like amoxicillin, clarithromycin and tetracycline may be given in conjunction with these other medications. These are not appropriate for children under 12. If a person is affected by anemia or B12 deficiency, B12 shots can be a solution.","Though gastritis arises from several different causes, a few steps can help safeguard against it:Avoiding smoking or using nicotine products
Drinking moderately and within recommended guidelines
Taking NSAIDs moderately and with food and water to prevent stomach irritation
Limiting consumption of irritant foods",[]
Acute HIV Infection,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-hiv-infection/,,"Many people develop symptoms of acute HIV infection two to four weeks after contracting HIV. Symptoms can last for several weeks and are similar to other viral infections such as flu. Signs and symptoms can include the following, starting with the most common:[3][4][5][6]Mouth ulcers
Red rash
Aching muscles
Joint pains
Unintentional weight loss
Fever
Loss of coordination
Tiredness
Headache
Swollen lymph nodes
Sore throat
DiarrheaSome HIV-infected people do not have any symptoms, or may have symptoms that are mild and not particularly troublesome.All these symptoms can also be caused by other illnesses. If a person has symptoms following potential exposure to HIV, they should be tested for HIV as soon as possible.[2] People concerned that they may be experiencing symptoms of acute HIV can also use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.","HIV is caused by a retrovirus which attacks the body’s immune system, specifically CD4 blood cells which are responsible for fighting infections. During acute HIV infection, the HIV retrovirus destroys a lot of CD4 cells as it replicates. This can cause some people to fall ill with flu-like symptoms.Acute HIV infection is the first stage of HIV infection. It is followed by two further stages:[2]Clinical latency, also known as asymptomatic HIV infection or chronic HIV infection. The HIV retrovirus continues to replicate within the body, but at low levels. The infected person may not experience any HIV-related symptoms, but can still transmit the virus to other people. Without treatment, this stage can last around 10 years. Towards the end of this phase, the person’s CD4 count starts to decrease and they may start to show symptoms.AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is the final stage of HIV infection. Without treatment, a person can expect to develop AIDS after approximately 10 years. During this stage, a person’s immune system is badly damaged and they are susceptible to severe illnesses such as chronic cryptosporidiosis, lymphoma and pneumonia. Without treatment, a person with AIDS will typically only live around three years.[7]Treatment can slow the progression of HIV infection, often by decades.Who is at risk of acute HIV infection?HIV can affect people of any age, sexual orientation or race, in any part of the world. However, certain groups of people are more at risk of contracting HIV than others. These can include people who:[8]Have unprotected sex, particularly anal sex, with multiple partners
Share needles when injecting substancesHIV can be spread in the following ways:[8][9]Contact with infected blood
Contact with infected semen
Contact with infected vaginal and/or rectal fluids
From mother to child during pregnancy or birth if the pregnant woman has HIV
Less commonly, during breastfeeding if the breastfeeding woman has HIV and is not on antiretroviral treatment[10]
Sharing needles, syringes or drug preparation equipment with someone who has HIVOther physical contact, such as hand-holding, kissing or hugging, does not transfer HIV..Risks of transmission during acute HIV infectionDuring the acute HIV infection phase, there are very high levels of HIV in the body. This means the risk of transmitting HIV to another person is high.[11]","The only way to confirm an acute HIV infection diagnosis is to be tested for HIV. There are different types of tests, depending on how long it has been since the person’s potential exposure to the HIV virus. Testing will involve either a sample of fluid swabbed from the mouth, or a blood sample.Antibody tests are the most common tests for HIV, including rapid tests and home tests. Antibody tests screen for HIV-1 antibodies, which are produced by the immune system after exposure to the HIV virus. It takes at least three weeks, and sometimes up to 12 weeks, for a person to develop enough antibodies to be detectable in this type of test.[12]Combination, or fourth-generation, tests detect both HIV-1 antibodies and p24 antigens. The p24 antigen is part of the HIV virus and can be detected as early as two weeks after infection in some people, although for others it can take up to six weeks. The amount of p24 antigen in the blood is gradually reduced by antibodies, which makes it unsuitable for use in diagnosing HIV after the very early stages.[12][13]Nucleic acid tests detect the HIV virus itself in the blood. The test is expensive and usually only used in cases where high-risk exposure has occurred, or the person has symptoms of acute HIV infection. Nucleic acid tests can detect the HIV virus as early as one week after infection in some people, but it may take up to four weeks until detection is possible for others.[12]HIV test window periodThe window period is the amount of time between when a person is first infected and when a test is able to accurately diagnose HIV infection:[14] The following numbers are a guide, as the exact numbers may vary between tests and labs.Antibody tests: 21 to 84 days after infection
Fourth generation tests: 13 to 42 days after infection
Nucleic acid tests: seven to 28 days after infectionThe first number for each test is the earliest possible time that an HIV infection can be detected with that test. However, each person responds differently to infection, so, in some cases, HIV may not be detectable until much later (indicated by the second number). If an early HIV test produces a negative result, it is advisable to have another test after the end of the window period.","Acute HIV infection is treated with antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), which are drugs specially designed to treat retroviruses. People with HIV are prescribed a combination of antiretroviral drugs, which together are known as antiretroviral therapy (ART).Antiretroviral therapy reduces the amount of virus (viral load) in the body. It does not cure HIV infection, but, taken correctly, it can slow progression of the condition from one stage to the next. For example, one recent study showed that a person diagnosed at age 20 who has appropriate treatment now has a life expectancy very close to that of a person without HIV.[15]Antiretroviral therapy should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis. It is very important to take antiretroviral medication correctly. Missing doses or stopping and restarting treatment can lead to drug resistance, which can reduce future treatment options.[16]Side-effects of ART may lead some people to consider stopping their medication. However, the long-term benefits of ART exceed the difficulties posed by some side-effects. It is very important not to stop taking ART without speaking with a doctor, who may be able to prescribe a more comfortable combination of antiretroviral drugs. More recent developments in ART mean that intolerable side-effects are fewer than in the past.[17]Side-effects associated with taking antiretroviral drugs include:[16][18]Nausea
Vomiting
Tiredness
Headache
Insomnia
Dry mouth
Diarrhea
Fever
Dizziness
Rash
Muscle painDoctors can generally tailor ART for a particular person to counter potential adverse effects, and a person may take various different antiretroviral drugs over the course of a lifetime.[17]More serious side-effects can emerge after taking antiretroviral drugs for a long time. These include:[18][17]Chronic renal failure
Diabetes
Osteoporosis
Liver damage
Heart disease
Hyperlipidemia, an excess of fats in the blood
Lipodystrophy, metabolic changes in how the body uses and stores fat
DepressionPeople who have contracted HIV become more susceptible to other medical conditions, so they will benefit from lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy and balanced diet, practicing safe sex and reducing stress levels. HIV infection often has a large emotional and psychological impact, so counseling and social support should be available throughout treatment.Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)PEP is a combination of antiretroviral drugs intended for use in emergency situations. When taken correctly, PEP can help to prevent HIV infection, but it is not 100 percent effective. Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) must be started as soon as possible after, and within 72 hours of, potential exposure to HIV infection.[19]PEP must be taken exactly as directed for 28 days. The drugs may cause side-effects, such as:[19][20][21]Nausea
Vomiting
Headaches
Tiredness
Diarrhea","There are ways to minimize the risk of contracting HIV, or passing the infection on to other people:[22]Practice safe sex: use condoms during all types of sexual contact and limit the number of partners
Practice safe needle use: use only sterile needles and equipment if injecting substances. Safe needle use should also be observed by healthcare workers and tattooists
Get diagnosed early, which can inform choices such as treatment and behavior toward other peopleAnyone who is sexually active is recommended to get tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases at least once a year. Any positive results should be disclosed to sexual partners so precautions can be taken. More frequent testing is recommended for anyone in a high risk group, such as someone who:[23]Is in a relationship with a person who is HIV-positive
Has multiple sexual partners
Shares needles or drug equipmentPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is another way of reducing the risk of acute HIV infection. PrEP is a combination of two medications that, taken daily, can lower a person’s chances of becoming infected with HIV.PrEP is typically recommended for people who are considered to be at high risk of contracting HIV. This can include anyone who:[23]Is in a relationship with a person who is HIV-positive
Is considering getting pregnant with a person who is HIV-positive
Has unprotected sex with people who are also at high risk of contracting HIV, such as people who inject drugs
Shares needles or drug equipmentTaken as directed, PrEP can reduce the risk of becoming infected with HIV by:[23]More than 90 percent during sex
More than 70 percent when injecting drugsPrEP should still be used alongside condoms as it does not provide protection against other STDs, such as gonorrhea.","Q: When does acute HIV infection occur?
A: Acute HIV infection is the first stage of HIV infection. Some people may feel ill with flu-like symptoms two to four weeks after being infected with HIV, while other people who have contracted HIV develop no symptoms at all.Q: How long do acute HIV infection symptoms last?
A: The symptoms of acute HIV infection, which can include flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph glands and mouth ulcers, generally last a few weeks. See the section on Symptoms of acute HIV infection.Q: How is acute HIV infection treated?
A: Acute HIV infection should be treated with antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) as soon as possible after diagnosis. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can help slow the progression of HIV by decades."
Acute Heart Failure,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-heart-failure/,,"Symptoms of acute heart failure can appear very quickly. It can be indicated by the appearance of new symptoms, or by an existing heart condition suddenly becoming worse.General symptoms of acute heart failure include:[5][6][7]Shortness of breath while moving or lying flat, also known as dyspnea
Feeling tired
Cough that may be worse at night or when lying down
Swelling of feet, ankles, legs, abdomen or veins in the neck
Cool peripheries, such as hands and feet, due to reduced cardiac output
Veins in the neck protrudingSwelling, also known as edema, is caused by fluid building up in different parts of the body because the heart is no longer able to pump efficiently. This is known as congestive heart failure. Depending on the location in the body of the fluid buildup or congestion, this can cause other symptoms. For example:[7]Congestion in the kidneys can mean less urine being produced during the day, which leads to frequent urination during the night
Congestion in the bowel can lead to nausea and vomitingLess common symptoms of acute heart failureNot everyone will experience the following symptoms of acute heart failure. Some of these symptoms are caused by an underlying condition. Less common symptoms of acute heart failure include:Palpitations, the feeling that the heart has skipped or added a beat, where the person has arrhythmia
Fever, which can be caused by underlying infection
Fainting, also called syncope
Blue/colored lips, skin or tongue, also called central cyanosisComplications of acute heart failureAcute heart failure can cause other conditions, often as a consequence of fluid building up in different parts of the body.Pulmonary edemaIf fluid builds up in the lungs, this causes a very serious condition called pulmonary edema. Fluid is pushed into air sacs which reduces the lungs’ ability to transfer oxygen into the blood. This leads to shortness of breath, particularly when lying down. Other symptoms can include:[8][9]Coughing or, in some cases, coughing up blood
Wheezing
Sluggishness
Anxiety
Swelling in the legs or abdomenPulmonary edema can be life-threatening. Anyone showing signs of pulmonary edema should see a doctor immediately.AscitesAcute heart failure can cause a buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity. This is called ascites and can cause pain in the abdomen, bloating and shortness of breath.[10]Cardiorenal syndromeAround one in four people who have acute heart failure also experience a significant worsening of kidney function, known as cardiorenal syndrome. The older a person is, the higher their risk of developing cardiorenal syndrome. The risk is increased if the person also has:[7][11]Hypertension
Diabetes
A history of heart and/or renal failure
AtherosclerosisCardiohepatic syndromeAcute heart failure can lead to a worsening of liver function. Liver cells can be destroyed through pressure building up due to blood slowing down before entering the heart, which is a very serious condition. It can cause:Jaundice, which is when skin and whites of eyes look yellow, urine becomes darker and stools become paler
Nausea
Vomiting
Abdominal painAnother potential complication is cholestasis, where bile flow reduces or stops. This can cause jaundice, itchy skin, dark urine and bad smelling stools.[7][12][13][14]","The heart weakens with age, which particularly affects its ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. This makes people over the age of 65 more susceptible to factors that can cause AHF, such as a different heart condition or existing symptoms of heart failure.There are various factors that can cause acute heart failure.Other heart conditions can lead to acute heart failure, such as:[5][15][16][17][18][19]Cardiomyopathy, the general name for a range of diseases which cause the heart muscle to become enlarged, thick or stiff
Blood clots, which can lead to myocardial ischemia, which is where blood clots can partially or completely block the flow of blood to the heart, leading to coronary artery disease
Myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle
Endocarditis, which is a rare infection of inner lining of the heart and heart valves
Disease of the heart valves, or defects which can be present from birth
Arrhythmia in the lower chambers of the heart (ventricular arrhythmia) or in the upper chambers (supraventricular arrhythmia)Hypertension is another cause of plaque buildup inside veins and can weaken the heart.Other factors that can damage the heart and increase the risk of acute heart failure include:[3][5][20]Abuse of alcohol and/or illegal drugs, particularly cocaine
HIV/AIDS
Thyroid disorders
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy during treatment for cancer
Too much iron in the body","Acute heart failure, as well as some of its complications such as pulmonary edema, is a very serious condition. Medical attention should be sought immediately if AHF is suspected.Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, patient history and physical examination for signs that the heart is failing to pump enough blood.Diagnostic tests can identify what type of heart failure is involved and which ventricle or side of the heart is involved, as treatments can differ. Tests that may be ordered include:[6][7][21][22]Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), which uses electrodes to monitor electrical activity in the heart
Blood oxygen levels should also be monitored
Various blood tests can show underlying causes for heart failure or reveal effects of complications
Chest X-ray, which can be useful to monitor response to treatment
Echocardiogram (an ECHO scan, or a heart ultrasound), which builds a picture of the heart as it pumps blood and can help identify the type of failure
MRI or computerised tomography (CT) scans can show damage to heart muscle
Nuclear ventriculography, which uses radioactive materials injected into the bloodstream to form an image of the heart movingTypes of heart failure which may occur in combination can be diagnosed by scanning, and testing the capabilities of the heart include:[5][23]Systolic failure: Also known as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), this is when the left ventricle stops contracting normally and cannot circulate blood around the body properly.
Diastolic failure: Also known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), this is when the left ventricle stops relaxing properly and so cannot fill with enough blood during a heartbeat.","Acute heart failure can be life-threatening and anyone with symptoms should see a doctor as soon as possible. Treatment is initially focused on alleviating life-threatening symptoms, then on the investigation of underlying causes and treatment of residual symptoms. Hospitalization is generally required while cardiac performance improves.[4]There are a range of potential treatments for acute heart failure. The treatment that is applied will depend on the person’s symptoms and the underlying issue causing them. For example:Shortness of breath (dyspnea): This symptom is treated with supplemental oxygen. The severity of dyspnea will dictate whether oxygen is supplied through a tube in the nose or a face mask. Sitting upright can help with breathing.[4][24]
Buildup of fluid: Intravenous diuretics are used to treat buildup of fluid within the body. A pulmonary edema will also be treated with diuretics, as well as oxygen and heart failure medication.[9][25]Ongoing management of acute heart failureMost patients with acute heart failure have worsening symptoms of chronic heart failure. As soon as the acute episode is stabilized, there are various types of medication which can be prescribed. Most of them are vasodilators, which widen the blood vessels to help lower blood pressure:[5][26][27][28][29][30]Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart
Hydralazine, isosorbide and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), all of which work by relaxing blood vessels to lower blood pressure
Aldosterone antagonists, which reduce the body’s sodium levels to lower blood pressure
Beta blockers, which lower blood pressure and slow the heart rate
Digoxin, which makes the heart beat more strongly
Nitrates, which are usually given as a vasodilator when the person also has pulmonary edema
Painkillers, such as morphine, may be useful to reduce anxiety in people who are restless and distressedOnce the initial symptoms of acute heart failure have been brought under control, the condition needs to be managed to avoid further episodes. Drugs such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers are commonly prescribed.[6]People with severe heart failure may need cardiology surgery. This will often involve implanting a device to regulate the heartbeat, a cardiac pacemaker.[5]Anyone who has experienced acute heart failure should take steps to lead a healthy lifestyle, which will reduce pressure on the heart. This includes eating a healthy diet and taking exercise. (See Preventing acute heart failure.)","Acute heart failure may be prevented by taking steps to maintain a healthy heart. This means following a healthy lifestyle:[31]Eating a healthy dietThis includes:Fruits and vegetables
Whole grains, such as whole grain bread or brown rice
Reduced meat consumption
Low fat or fat-free dairy products
Beans, nuts and seeds
Limiting foods high in saturated and trans fats, such as full fat cheese and processed food
Avoiding foods that are high in salt/sodium or with added sugarsGood to know: Everyone who adapts their diet should consult their doctor to ensure that their food plan is right for them, as this differs between people, depending on any food sensitivities they may have and their general overall health.Other lifestyle adaptations for preventing acute heart failureKeep hydrated: Opt for water or non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated beverages with no added sugar. For people who wish to drink alcohol, it is recommended that men consume no more than two alcoholic drinks per day and women consume no more than one alcoholic drink per day.
Avoid using tobacco products: Doctors can provide advice on targeted services for those seeking to quit or cut down.
Avoid using illegal drugs
Get at least a moderate amount of exercise, such as two hours and 30 minutes of brisk walking per week
Maintain an appropriate weight, aiming for a body mass index (BMI) of 20-25
Manage stress levels, such as taking up meditation or exercise, or joining a therapy groupHypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a risk factor for developing acute and chronic heart failure. To learn more about how to prevent or manage high blood pressure, see the resource on hypertension.Diabetes and coronary heart disease, a condition where a substance called plaque builds up in the artery walls, are also risk factors for acute heart failure. People with these conditions should speak with their doctor about treatment options.[5]Chronic heart failure can lead to acute heart failure. People with chronic heart failure should learn how to recognize the early signs of worsening heart failure.","Q: Can acute heart failure be cured?
A: There are different underlying causes of acute heart failure. Most people who develop acute heart failure actually experience a worsening of existing chronic heart failure symptoms. In these cases, there is no definite cure. However, steps can be taken to manage symptoms and to prevent the condition becoming worse. See Preventing acute heart failure."
Acute Laryngitis,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-laryngitis/,,"Typical symptoms of laryngitis include:Dysphonia (hoarseness of the voice)
Fever (during the first few days of infection)
Sore throat
A need to clear the throat frequently
A coughSymptoms usually appear suddenly and worsen after around three days.[1] After around three weeks, with appropriate treatment including drinking plenty of water and resting the larynx, symptoms such as a cough and hoarse voice usually relieve.Even though acute laryngitis usually relives without the need for medical attention, it is important for an affected person to see a doctor promptly if they:Experience swallowing problems (dysphagia)
Cough up blood
Have trouble breathing
Have a persistent fever, with a temperature of higher than 103 F (39.4 C)
Have respiratory problems (breathing difficulties)These symptoms may indicate epiglottis, a condition in which the tissue that covers the lid of the windpipe becomes inflamed. Epiglottis can be life-threatening for both children and adults.[2]In children, the symptoms of laryngitis are the same as those in adults. When children under five are affected, the condition is called croup. Croup usually clears up in 5-7 days, and medical attention should be sought if their symptoms of infection do not improve during this timeframe. Antibiotics are not used to treat croup, because it is caused by a viral infection.[3]People experiencing possible symptoms of acute laryngitis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.","There are both infectious and non-infectious causes of acute laryngitis. The most common causes are a flu or cold due to a virus. Non-infectious causes include overuse of the voice, gastric reflux (which can irritate the lining of the throat), or an injury to the voice box region.The hoarseness of the voice (dysphonia) which results from laryngitis is caused by the distorted shape of the inflamed larynx. Because the vocal cords in the larynx are swollen, the air passing over them makes sounds (speech) which are different from normal.","The diagnosis is usually made by examination of the throat. Doctors will focus on diagnosing the cause of the laryngitis, because this will determine the appropriate treatment, if any is needed. If laryngitis is due to a known underlying condition such as gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD), the treatment and management plan for this may be adjusted, to prevent further laryngeal problems.Doctors may perform a laryngoscopy to examine the larynx, to help them determine the cause of laryngitis.[4] This may be done indirectly or directly. An indirect laryngoscopy involves the doctor shining a light into the throat to examine the larynx, using a handheld mirror. A direct laryngoscopy involves the doctor inserting a small tube with a camera attached to it into the throat through the mouth to examine the larynx in detail.","Treatment depends on the source of the problem, but mainly involves resting the larynx, by not overusing the voice while hoarseness is present,.Drinking warm liquids and using medicated throat lozenges may be useful to soothe the throat.Home remedies such as adding ginger or tumeric to warm drinks can help fight causal infections. Simple pain medications (ibuprofen or paracetamol) can help with the pain. If the condition is caused by bacteria, the treatment may involve antibiotics.","Prevention can be achieved by moderate use of the voice, and taking care to avoid catching or spreading viruses. Giving up smoking may also help to avoid laryngitis.","Q: Is acute laryngitis contagious?
A: Yes. However, the degree to which it is contagious depends on whether the cause(s) of laryngitis are bacterial/fungal, viral, or whether it is due to an underlying condition. Most cases of laryngitis result from viruses, which themselves are not particularly contagious. Research suggests that the most likely time frame for viruses that cause laryngitis to be passed on to others is the period when the infected person has a fever. A person who is only affected by a hoarse voice, sore throat and cough is less likely to be contagious. Instances of bacterial and fungal causes of laryngitis are less common, but these kinds of infections are more contagious than viruses and therefore more likely to result in transmission. Washing hands regularly, particularly after coughing, and avoiding sharing food or utensils, are important preventative measures for avoiding the transmission of laryngitis.Q: What happens when laryngitis becomes chronic?
A: Chronic laryngitis is less likely to be caused by bacterial or viral infections than acute laryngitis, and more likely to be caused by an ongoing problem or condition, such as by acid reflux from gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD), habitual overuse of the voice which damages the vocal cords, excessive alcohol use, use of tobacco products (especially smoking), or chronic sinusitis. The symptoms of acute (short-lasting) laryngitis are the same as those of chronic (long-lasting) laryngitis, including a sore throat, hoarseness of the voice and having a cough. It is important to seek treatment if symptoms persist, because vocal cord strain and growths on the vocal cords can develop as a result of continual inflammation of the larynx."
Acute Otitis Media,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-otitis-media/,,"Typical symptoms of a middle ear infection are pain in the ear and difficulty hearing with the affected ear. There may also be headaches and fever. Severe cases may cause a burst eardrum and pus may run from the ear, though this is much more common when children are affected, and is uncommon in adults.",[],The diagnosis is usually made by a doctor based on the symptoms and physical examination. An otoscope may be used - a small tool used to look at the eardrum.,"The main treatment of middle ear infections is pain relief. Warm compresses or pain medication (such as ibuprofen and paracetamol) are both helpful for managing ear pain. Antibiotics are often not needed to treat middle ear infections, but may be offered to people with complicated ear infections or other medical issues.",Taking care to prevent the spread of colds or the flu in the home and community can help prevent some cases of otitis media. Quitting smoking and avoiding things that trigger allergies may also be helpful in avoiding middle ear infections.,[]
Acute Pancreatitis,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-pancreatitis/,,"The main symptom of acute pancreatitis is pain in the upper abdomen, that may then spread to the back. This pain can:[3][4][5]Be severe enough to require strong painkillers
Appear suddenly, where the cause is gallstones
Appear one to three days following a drinking binge or stopping drinking, where the cause is alcohol
Persist for several days
Be made worse by coughing, deep breathing and moving vigorously
Sometimes be eased by leaning forwardOther symptoms of acute pancreatitis include:Nausea and vomiting
Fever
Loss of appetite
Elevated heart rate
Tender abdomen
Blue/gray skin discoloration around the sides, also known as the Grey Turner sign or ecchymoses of the flanks
Blue/gray skin discoloration around the navel, also known as the Cullen sign or ecchymoses of the flanks","60 to 75 percent of acute pancreatitis cases are caused by gallstones or high intake of alcohol. There is no identifiable cause for around 20 percent of acute pancreatitis cases; this is known as idiopathic pancreatitis.[5]GallstonesGallstones can trigger acute pancreatitis by blocking the drainage duct shared by the pancreas and the gallbladder. This stops pancreatic enzymes flowing normally and causes pancreatitis.[5]Alcohol useHeavy alcohol use over a prolonged period of time can cause acute pancreatitis. It is unclear how alcohol causes pancreatitis, though there are theories that alcohol may convert into chemicals that damage the pancreas, or that alcohol blocks the pancreatic duct.[3]The risk of pancreatitis increases with heavy alcohol use, which is considered to be:Four to seven drinks a day for men
Three or more drinks a day for womenIf a person with acute pancreatitis drinks less than these amounts, the condition may still progress to chronic pancreatitis. Alcohol should be completely avoided while undergoing treatment for acute pancreatitis.Cystic fibrosisCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that causes some glands to function abnormally. In people with cystic fibrosis, the pancreas produces secretions that can block the gland. Having cystic fibrosis increases the risk for repeatedly developing acute pancreatitis and also increases the risk of developing chronic pancreatitis.[3][6]MedicationsThe following medications may cause acute pancreatitis as an uncommon, but potentially severe side effect:[3]Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, used to treat hypertension and heart failure
Azathioprine, used in kidney transplants and for rheumatoid arthritis
Furosemide, used to treat hypertension
6-mercaptopurine, used to treat acute lymphocytic leukemia
Pentamidine, used to treat pneumonia
Sulfonamides, a class of synthetic antibiotics
Valproate, used to treat seizures and bipolar disorderEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)3 to 5 percent of people who have a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) go on to develop acute pancreatitis. ERCP uses an endoscope, which is a flexible tube inserted into the esophagus, stomach and intestine to examine the bile and pancreatic ducts.[7]Other causes of pancreatitisLess common causes of pancreatitis include:[4][8][9]Mumps
Mononucleosis/Epstein-Barr virus
HIV
Parasitic infection, such as ascariasis, toxoplasmosis or cryptosporidium
High cholesterol levels
Pancreatic cancer","Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on the symptoms and a physical examination. A diagnosis will generally be confirmed if two of the following three symptoms are present:[5]Abdominal pain
Increases of amylase and lipase levels in the blood that are threefold or higher
Inflamed pancreas, seen on a CT scan or MRI scanBlood tests may be ordered to investigate if the pancreas is working properly and to look for signs of inflammation. Blood tests can check for:[3][10]High levels of digestive enzymes made by the pancreas, called amylase and lipase
High blood glucose levels
High levels of blood fats, called lipids
Signs of infection
Pancreatic cancerImaging scans can be used to diagnose acute pancreatitis and also to identify complications such as necrosis, death of living tissue, or fluid collection. Scans that may be performed include:[3][10]Computed tomography (CT) scan, to create a picture of the pancreas, gallbladder and bile ducts
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), another method of creating a picture of the pancreas, gallbladder and bile ducts
Ultrasound, which can be used to identify gallstones","Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition and can lead to complications such as fluid-filled pseudocysts, damage to the pancreas and heart and lung or kidney failure. However, with appropriate treatment, most people recover well.[1][11]People with acute pancreatitis are usually admitted to hospital. Treatment generally includes:Fluids administered intravenously
Painkillers
Drugs to reduce nausea and vomiting
Feeding by tube or intravenously if the person cannot eat
Antibiotics, if the person has an infection in the pancreasTreatment for acute pancreatitis caused by gallstonesIf acute pancreatitis is caused by gallstones, this condition also needs to be treated. There are various options to treat gallstones:Surgical removal of the gallbladder. This is a common procedure and will prevent acute pancreatitis caused by gallstones recurring.[12]Non-surgical options to eliminate gallstones may be possible where a person is unable to have their gallbladder removed, such as because of old age or other medical conditions. However, without gallbladder removal, acute pancreatitis caused by gallstones is likely to recur in 30 to 50 percent of cases.[12]Non-surgical options for eliminating gallstones include:[12][13]Bile acid pill, to break down small gallstones caused by cholesterol
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), to remove gallstones from the bile duct
Shock wave lithotripsy, a rarely offered procedure which uses shock waves to break up larger gallstones","Eating a healthy diet that is rich in fiber, fruits, vegetables and whole grains and avoiding unhealthy fats can reduce the risk of developing gallstones.[14]Stopping drinking alcohol and stopping smoking can help prevent future episodes of acute pancreatitis and prevent progression to chronic pancreatitis.[15]","Q: Are acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer linked?
A: If not properly managed, repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis can lead to chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is linked to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. However, most people with pancreatitis will not develop pancreatic cancer.[16]"
Acute Panic Attack,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-panic-attack/,,"People who experience a panic attack are not usually aware that the episode is going to occur until it begins, particularly if the affected individual has not experienced a panic attack before.Symptoms before onsetPhysiological changes in the body – such as an increasing heart rate – have been found to occur up to an hour in advance of a panic attack, but the first perceptible signs generally only become apparent as the attack begins. These include symptoms of mental distress, such as the belief that one is dying, and concurrent physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate (palpitations), sweating and trembling.There are typically no perceptible signs of the onset of a panic attack. However, research has been conducted to test the hypothesis that panic attacks occur spontaneously. Findings suggest that imperceptible changes in the body can begin before the actual panic attack begins.Physiological changes, which may take place up to an hour in advance of a panic attack, include:[2]Irregular breathing patterns
Increased heart rateHowever, these physiological indicators are subtle, unlike the symptoms that are present during a panic attack itself. In general, they go unnoticed by the affected individual and those around them and do not serve as an advance indicator of the panic attack they precede.Symptoms during a panic attackAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), four or more of the following physical and psychological symptoms must be present:[3]Palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate
Sweating
Trembling or shaking
Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering
Feeling of choking
Chest pain or discomfort
Nausea or abdominal distress
Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint
Chills or heat sensations
Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations)
Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself)
Fear of losing control or going crazy
Fear of dyingIf four or more of the above symptoms are present, it is known as a full-symptom panic attack. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms.

This is called a limited-symptom panic attack.Limited-symptom panic attacks are often experienced by people undergoing effective treatment for panic disorder, as they learn to use therapeutic techniques to reduce the number and severity of the symptoms they experience during an attack.DurationThe duration of a panic attack is usually between 5 and 20 minutes, with most panic attacks reaching their peak at around 10 minutes.Nearly all panic attacks subside in under an hour, at which point the physical and psychological symptoms will be alleviating or no longer be present. It is normal to feel exhausted and shaken by the experience of having a panic attack after the attack itself is over, and there are many techniques, such as breathing exercises, which can help one begin to feel better.Recurrent panic attacksIt is possible for a person to become so distressed by a panic attack that, rather than calming down afterwards, they experience a recurrent panic attack or several. One should not be concerned about one’s long-term health if one experiences one or more subsequent attacks after the initial episode, as there are no long-term health consequences.Learning coping techniques, such as breathing exercises to perform in the event of a panic attack, can help one calm down efficiently, reducing the likelihood of recurrent panic attacks.Nocturnal panic attackIt is possible to experience a panic attack in one’s sleep. This is called a nocturnal panic attack and involves waking up in a state of panic.[4] Nocturnal panic attacks are no different from panic attacks that occur when one is awake, in terms of their symptoms, duration and possible triggers.Nocturnal panic attacks are a common occurrence in people with panic disorder, but can also be one’s first or only experience of a panic attack.Panic attack or heart attack?The symptoms of a panic attack can be similar to those of a heart attack. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.It is common for people experiencing a panic attack to become convinced that they are having a heart attack during the episode. Although this may be related to the distressing thoughts that accompany a panic attack, emergency medical services should be called if a heart attack is suspected, as – unlike a panic attack – a heart attack requires prompt medical attention and can be life-threatening.Key differences between a heart attack and a panic attack include:[5]Tingling: In a heart attack, a person may experience a tingling sensation in their left arm, whereas in a panic attack the tingling sensation, if present, will affect the entire body.
Breathing: A panic attack often causes hyperventilation (breathing too quickly) but a heart attack does not. However, both panic and heart attacks can cause the sensation of shortness of breath.
Vomiting: It is common to vomit during a heart attack, but less common to do so during a panic attack.
Pain in a panic attack: The sensation will be sharp, will feel worse when one breathes deeply or puts pressure on the chest and will usually be felt all over the heart. It will disappear within five to ten minutes.
Pain in a heart attack: The sensation will be like a crushing feeling all over the chest and may extend into the shoulders, left arm, neck and back. It will last longer than ten minutes and will not be made worse by breathing or pressing on the chest.Despite being able to identify these differences, it is advisable to always seek medical attention if the affected person:[6]Has a history of heart attacks
Meets the risk criteria for a heart attack, such as high blood pressure, being overweight, getting limited physical exercise
Has never had a panic attack beforeIf one is not deemed to be at risk of a heart attack, psychotherapeutic techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be recommended in order to help the affected person overcome any long-term anxiety about having a heart attack. This will help prevent a fear of having a heart attack from manifesting in, or forming the basis of, future panic attacks.","Anxiety disorder (AD) is the principal cause of all panic attacks. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), approximately 40 million adults in the U.S. between the ages of 18 and 51 are diagnosed as being affected by anxiety disorders. However, the total number of people who are affected by anxiety disorders – and who are therefore predisposed to experience a panic attack – is thought to be far greater.[7]Panic is the most acute form of anxiety. As such, a panic attack is caused by heightened anxiety, whereby the body undergoes physiological changes due to one’s thoughts, entering into a state called fight or flight mode. A person may not be consciously aware of the thoughts that induce this state, as it can be caused by the brain’s background activity.Fight or flight mode is an automatic response to danger, rapidly preparing the body for physical activity, such as running away from or fighting off a predator. In a panic attack, however, there is usually no immediate physical threat to escape from.[8]Physiological changes associated with fight or flight mode, that may contribute to a panic attack, include:Increased metabolic rate
Increased heart rate
Release of metabolic energy resources such as glycogen
Inhibited action of the digestive system
Constriction of blood vessels
Loss of hearing and dilation of pupils
Relaxation of the bladder and sphinctersRisk factors for experiencing a panic attackAlthough anyone may be affected by a panic attack, a range of factors may increase the likelihood for certain individuals. People who have a disorder that leads to elevated levels of anxiety are more likely to experience a panic attack. This includes:Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): A form of chronic anxiety that is often unrelated to a particular cause.
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): In the case of OCD, a person experiences recurrent unwanted thoughts and compulsive behaviors. This can lead to panic attacks in some people, although, according to DSM-5 criteria, OCD is no longer listed as anxiety disorder.
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Although PTSD is a trauma and stressor-related disorder rather than an anxiety disorder, panic attacks may relate to anxiety from PTSD, that develops after first or second-hand exposure to a traumatic event.
Social phobia: In people with social phobia, everyday situations regularly cause debilitating levels of anxiety.Other mental health conditions, such as depression, can also cause the anxious kinds of thinking that may precipitate a panic attack.[9]Other factors, which increase one’s likelihood of experiencing a panic attack, include:[3]Heredity: The exact link between people’s genetic makeup and their predisposition to panic attacks is not yet fully understood, but people with panic disorder often have family members – particularly siblings – who are also affected.[10]
Intelligence: Having a high intelligence quotient (IQ) is associated with introspection. Spending lots of time alone, thinking, can lead to the development of the anxious thought cycles that precipitate panic attacks.
Temperament: Being prone to experiencing negative emotions (negative affectivity), and being prone to believing that one’s anxiety symptoms are harmful (anxiety sensitivity), are both contributing factors to the likelihood of experiencing a panic attack.[11]
Environment: Many people experience a panic attack as a result of stressors in their immediate environment, such as a currently stressful life experience. However, previous stressors can increase the likelihood of experiencing a panic attack in later life, and childhood trauma and abuse are common among those who are affected by panic attacks or panic disorder in adulthood.
Chemically induced: Smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol excessively, illicit substance misuse and adverse reactions to prescription medication are also linked to an increased likelihood of experiencing a panic attack.
Health problems: it is not uncommon for people experiencing ongoing ill health to develop anxiety related to their condition and prognosis. This can happen whether or not one’s health problem(s) is/are biologically conducive to anxiety or not, in the sense that they involve physical changes conducive to developing anxiety or fight or flight mode.
Biological causes: Certain conditions affect factors, like one’s hormone levels, breathing and heart rate, increasing the chances of one’s body unnecessarily entering fight or flight mode, which can cause a panic attack.Conditions which increase the likelihood of experiencing a panic attack include:Hyperthyroidism, i.e. excessive production of the thyroid hormone
Hypoglycemia ‒ low blood sugar
Wilson’s disease, an excessive deposition of copper in the brain, liver and other tissues
Labyrinthitis, an inflammation in the nerves of the inner ear
Mitral valve prolapse, when the mitral valve in the heart does not close as tightly as in healthy people
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, an abnormal increase in heart rate after sitting up or standing
Pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland tissue",[],[],"Preventing future panic attacks involves identifying the causal stressors and adopting self-care habits which can reduce one’s propensity to anxious thought processes.It is important not to adapt one’s routine in a way, which involves avoiding situations and circumstances related to one’s panic attacks. Not only will this become debilitating, but avoidance can result in developing additional anxiety disorders such as social phobia.[16]Techniques for preventing panic attacks include:Daily breathing exercises encourage deep breathing and combat one’s tendency to adopt the irregular or shallow breathing patterns. Shallow breathing is a symptom of panic attacks. Additionally, usually practicing irregular or shallow breathing can contribute to a person being in an anxious mindset in general, which makes experiencing a panic attack more likely.
Adopting cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques can change the thought processes which contribute to panic attacks. Daily use of CBT techniques can reduce one’s overall anxiety over time, helping to prevent panic attacks in the long term.
Regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise can release tension, improve one’s breathing and increase one’s self-esteem, which can reduce one’s predisposition to the  anxious thought cycles that induce panic attacks.
Avoiding stimulants, such as caffeine and tobacco.
Avoiding alcohol, in particular, avoiding drinking alcohol to excess as a coping strategy for anxiety or panic attacks. Withdrawal from alcohol can be a contributing factor to panic attacks.
Eating regular, balanced meals to promote stable blood sugar levels and general well-being.",[]
Acute Pharyngitis,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-pharyngitis/,,"A variety of symptoms are associated with pharyngitis, with some of the most common including:[2]Sore throat
Pain or difficulty when swallowing or talking
Swollen, sore glands in the neck or throat
Red throat and red, swollen tonsils
A hoarse voice
White or grey patches on the back of the throatA sore throat is the characteristic symptom of pharyngitis and – in some cases – may be the only symptom. A cobblestone appearance at the back of the throat, colloquially known as “cobblestone throat”, is in some cases present. This is a distinctive lumpy, irritated appearance of the back of the throat, caused by enlarged lymphatic tissue. It is visible on visual inspection. It can also be caused by a post-nasal drip, in which mucus that accumulates in the back of the nose and throat drips downward from the back of the nose.Commonly, pharyngitis is caused by an underlying condition such as a common cold or flu. If this is the case, it may be accompanied by symptoms of these conditions, such as fever, coughing or a runny nose. If you think that you or a loved one may have a cold, flu or pharyngitis, you can start a free symptom assessment with Ada now.","Pharyngitis is usually caused by the viruses that also cause a common cold or flu. In rare cases, the condition can be caused by bacteria. It is difficult to determine whether a case of pharyngitis has a viral or bacterial cause, since the symptoms are similar.[3] Smoking, vaping and exposure to airborne irritants can also cause a sore throat.Viral infectionViral conditions that can lead to pharyngitis include:Flu
Common cold (adenovirus infection)
Measles
Chickenpox
Mononucleosis (mono, caused by the Epstein-Barr virus)
Croup (a childhood illness)
Herpes simplex infection
Enterovirus infectionThe viruses that cause the condition are contagious, normally spread by discharge from the nose or mouth. A virus can also survive on objects or clothing and be spread in this way.Pharyngitis and Epstein-Barr virus mononucleosisA sore, scratchy throat is a major symptom of mononucleosis, also known as mono or glandular fever, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Mononucleosis of this kind is most common among teenagers and younger adults. Other symptoms include:[4][5]Severe fatigue
Appetite loss
Fever
Muscle pain
Swollen lymph nodesSome people may also develop a rash. Tonsillitis can often occur in mononucleosis.HIV-related pharyngitisIn acute HIV infection, pharyngitis is a common symptom. The symptoms of pharyngitis associated with HIV infection are the same as those of mononucleosis-related pharyngitis (see above), and also often present with tonsillitis. Symptoms that may occur in people affected by pharyngitis accompanying HIV infection are:[4]Fever
Sweats
Malaise and lethargy
Lack of appetite
Swollen lymph glands.Bacterial infection, such as strep throatA number of bacterial infections can also cause pharyngitis, most commonly Streptococcal bacteria, otherwise known as group A streptococcus. In these cases, the condition is known as strep throat. Other bacteria that far less frequently cause pharyngitis include:[5]Neisseria gonorrhoeae
Corynebacterium
Chlamydia pneumoniae
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Group C, G or F StreptococcusGroup A streptococcus is the most common cause of tonsillitis (15-30% of cases).Good to know: Group B streptococcus is not usually associated with strep throat or other upper respiratory tract infections. However, group B strep can cause pharyngitis, with tonsillitis and swollen lymph glands in the neck.[6]Pharyngitis and strep throatStrep throat is typically spread through person-to-person contact, commonly through bacteria in saliva or nasal discharge. Symptoms and signs of strep throat include:[7]A sore throat and pain when swallowing which is more severe than with a normal sore throat.
Fever, weakness and headache.
Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, especially in children.
White or grey patches visible on the back of the throat.
Swollen, sore glands in the neck (lymph nodes).
A widespread red rash.If the strep throat symptoms occur after several days of coughing and a runny nose, it’s more likely that they are the result of a viral infection rather than Group A streptococcus.[3] If you’re concerned that you may have strep throat or tonsillitis rather than pharyngitis, why not do a free Ada symptom assessment now?","A doctor will usually diagnose the condition through a physical examination that may include:A close look at the throat, ears and nasal passageway
Checking for swollen glands
Listening to a person’s breathing using a stethoscopeIf bacterial pharyngitis is suspected, a doctor may also take a swab from the throat and have it tested for the presence of bacteria.Pharyngitis and tonsillitisPharyngitis is a common symptom in tonsillitis, so much so that the condition is sometimes known as tonsillopharyngitis. Tonsillitis is a condition in which the tonsils in the throat become inflamed. It can be caused by viruses, such as the Epstein-Barr virus, or bacteria, such as Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus or Staphylococcus aureus. Most cases of acute tonsillitis are viral, but chronic or recurring tonsillitis is usually bacterial in origin.[8][9]The symptoms of bacterial tonsillitis usually develop suddenly. They include:[8][9]A red and swollen throat that is painful
Fever
Difficulty swallowing or painful swallowing
Foul breath
Painful lymph nodes in the neckIn viral tonsillitis, the affected person may also have:[9]A headache
An earache
Nasal congestion or stuffiness
A coughVery swollen tonsils may cause airway obstruction. The symptoms of airway obstruction include:[8]Breathing through the mouth
Snoring
Disordered breathing during sleep
Lethargy and a general feeling of unwellnessIf the affected person has difficulty opening their mouth, or their voice takes on a muffled quality as if they are speaking with a hot potato in their mouth, they may have peritonsillar abscess. This is an abscess around the region of the tonsils, and is a medical emergency, because it can cause sepsis and airway obstruction.For more information on the symptoms and treatment of tonsillitis, see this page. If you’re concerned that you may have strep throat or tonsillitis rather than pharyngitis, why not do a free Ada symptom assessment now?Pharyngitis and laryngitisLaryngitis is a condition where the larynx, or voice box, becomes inflamed due to overuse or a viral infection. The most common cause is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract; bacterial laryngitis is rare.[10] It is often found in conjunction with a sore throat, or pharyngitis.Coughing is linked to laryngitis, and therefore it often occurs in conjunction with diseases such as bronchitis, pneumonia, influenza, measles, whooping cough or diphtheria.Symptoms of laryngitis include:[10]Hoarseness or other changes in voice
Tickling sensations in the throat
A raw throat
An urge to clear the throatIf a severe viral infection is present, the affected person may also have:[10]Fever
Malaise
Difficulty swallowing
Sore throat.In some cases, a sore throat and voice changes might be caused by laryngeal cancer. This cancer is, however, quite rare. Important risk factors include smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Human papillomavirus infection and gastroesophageal reflux disease can also increase a person’s risk of laryngeal cancer.For more information, see this resource on laryngitis.","Most cases of pharyngitis will go away without treatment in a week or less. Antibiotics are not helpful in cases of pharyngitis caused by viral infections, and are only used in cases where a bacterial infection is lingering. Most treatment for pharyngitis can be carried out at home, using over-the-counter products.Home remedies for pharyngitisThere are a number of ways to help manage the symptoms of the condition:[11]Drinking plenty of fluids is key to avoiding dehydration, which can make the symptoms of pharyngitis worse.
Taking ibuprofen or paracetamol is a good way of managing pain, headaches and fever. These medicines should be taken according to the instructions on the packet.
Lozenges can be useful in easing pain.
Other over-the-counter products, such as anesthetic sprays, which can be bought from pharmacies and stores, can also help alleviate certain symptoms.Antibiotics for pharyngitisAntibiotics are ineffective against viral pharyngitis, though,  they may be prescribed for those with a bacterial infection.Doctors are often reluctant to prescribe antibiotics for bacterial pharyngitis due to the fact that they are not always effective and may cause side-effects. To decide if an individual should be prescribed antibiotics, doctors will sometimes use a test known as the Centor score. They will look for:[12]Pus on the tonsils
Painful or tender glands on the neck
The absence of a cough
FeverIf three or more of these features are present, a doctor will often prescribe a delayed prescription, whereby antibiotics will be prescribed for two or three days in the future, to be used if symptoms have not disappeared or have gotten worse.","Pharyngitis is contagious, meaning there are a number of ways to reduce the risk of contracting the condition. These include:[13]Avoiding sharing utensils, food and drink
Avoiding contact with people experiencing the condition
Thorough and frequent washing of the hands, especially after coughing or sneezing and before eating","Q: What is the difference between pharyngitis and laryngitis?
A: Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the pharynx, whereas laryngitis is an inflammation of the larynx, or the voice box. The main symptom of laryngitis is hoarseness or complete loss of the voice. Usually, treatment for both conditions is similar.[15]Q: What is the difference between pharyngitis and tonsillitis?
A: Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the pharynx, whereas tonsillitis is an inflammation of the tonsils, a pair of tissue masses at the rear of the throat. Symptoms of tonsillitis include soreness in the lower throat and hoarseness of the voice.[16] Pharyngitis and tonsillitis can occur at the same time – when this occurs, the condition is referred to as pharyngotonsillitis.[17]Q: What is strep throat?
A: Strep throat is a bacterial sore throat caused by Streptococcal bacteria, otherwise known as group A streptococcus. The pain and difficulty swallowing experienced as a result of strep throat are typically more severe than in cases of a viral sore throat. Moreover, symptoms not associated with a viral sore throat may also be experienced. These include:Fever, weakness and headache.
White or grey patches visible on the back of the throat.
Swollen, sore glands in the neck (lymph nodes).

Acute Pyelonephritis,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-pyelonephritis/,,"The most distinctive features of acute pyelonephritis are pain in the back, flank or belly,  fever at or above 38℃/100.4℉, chills, nausea and vomiting. If flank, belly or back pain is not present, doctors should consider other diagnoses. Other symptoms of pyelonephritis include:[1][2]Urine that has an unusual or unpleasant smell
Hematuria (blood in the urine)
Urinary frequency
Urinary urgency
Dysuria (painful or difficult urination)
Oliguria (lack of urine)
Hypotension (low blood pressure).In babies and toddlers, a high fever may be the only symptom. In men and women older than 65 years of age, the above-mentioned symptoms may be absent and additional symptoms may include:Confusion

In these cases, hospitalisation may be required. These conditions include:[1]Anatomical abnormalities of the genitourinary system
Multi-drug-resistant bacteria underlying the infection
A weakened immune system, for example as a result of chemotherapy or HIV/AIDS
Obstructions in the urethra, bladder or ureters
Use of inappropriate antibiotics as the first course of treatment
Underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus, existing renal dysfunction, liver or cardiac disease or urological disorders",[],"Apart from noting the symptoms mentioned above, doctors examining a patient with suspected acute pyelonephritis will obtain a urine sample from them, and perform a basic test for abnormal color and odor. Additionally, they may perform tests such as:[2][5]Dipstick analysis, which may be positive for blood, nitrite or leukocyte esterase. The latter is an enzyme produced by white blood cells.
Urinalysis (analysis of the urine) to check for white blood cell casts and microscopic pyuria, i.e. pus in the urine.
A bacterial culture of the urine to determine what kind of bacteria has caused the pyelonephritis. This may be particularly useful if the first line of antibiotic treatments does not clear up the infection, suggesting that the bacteria is drug-resistant or that another pathogen is responsible.
Blood tests, such as a complete blood count should be performed in more complicated cases, along with analysis of inflammation markers. Markers that can indicate declining kidney function, and measurement of electrolytes may be necessary, too.
Imaging tests such as an MRI, CT scan or ultrasound.Doctors will also take a history from the patient to determine whether any underlying disorders, such as a genitourinary abnormality or diabetes mellitus, are present and gather information about their lifestyle, for example, whether or not the patient is sexually active, experiences stress urinary incontinence, etc to find out what may have caused the infection to set in.","Most people affected by  acute pyelonephritis are successfully treated with  antibiotics and do not need to be hospitalised. However, in cases of very severe and/or complicated infections, hospitalisation may be safest in order to monitor the infection consistently and to control its spread most effectively. Hospitalisation can be avoided if treatment is sought early on in the course of the infection.Outpatient treatmentBed rest, painkillers and hydration are the cornerstones of home treatment for acute pyelonephritis. Staying well hydrated helps to heal the kidneys and flush out the pathogens. However, over-hydration is counterproductive and should be avoided. Painkillers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen can be taken orally to manage pain.[6]The most common form of treatment for acute pyelonephritis is antibiotics. In some cases, the infection may involve drug-resistant strains of bacteria or the wrong dosage or wrong drug is prescribed.[2] In such instances, antibiotics will not work and the risk of developing complications increases. However, antibiotics generally do work.Some of the oral antibiotics most commonly prescribed are:[2][7][8]Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin), in areas where drug resistance is low
Ceftriaxone
GentamicinOral beta-lactam antibiotics, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are generally not helpful. There is considerable resistance to fluoroquinolones among e. coli bacteria, and so treatment with such antibiotics may not be efficacious.[2][9]HospitalisationIn cases of severe or complicated infection, hospitalisation is advised. Much like home treatment, inpatient treatment involves antibiotics, painkillers and monitoring for approximately five days and possibly longer, depending on local practice. In some cases, surgery may be required to deal with underlying conditions causing complications, such as enlarged prostate or kidney stones. Also, in severe cases, surgery may be necessary to drain pus away from the kidneys. Antibiotics may be delivered intravenously into a vein in the arm, via a drip, including:[2][7][8]Cephalosporins like Ceftriaxone
Aminoglycosides like Gentamicin or Tobramycin
Carbapenems like Meropenem
Broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics like piperacillin, in combination with tazobactamThere are certain circumstances in which a patient should be hospitalised. Sepsis and septic shock are serious complications of acute pyelonephritis, and if any signs of sepsis are present, the patient should be hospitalised without delay. Other circumstances suggesting that hospitalisation would be wise include:[3]Metabolic problems, such as acidosis
A fever of more than 39℃/102℉
Signs of, or risk of, sepsis (see below)
Dehydration and/or inability to take liquids or medications by mouth
Very severe flank or abdominal pain, vomiting and debility
Oliguria or anuria: very little or no urine being produced
Social issues, such as homelessness or an unsafe home environment
Likelihood that the patient will not cooperate with treatment at home
Inadequate access to follow-up care, for example poor patients or patients living in rural areas, living alone or without transportSigns of sepsis include:[10][11]High fever above 38℃/100.4℉ OR low body temperature (below 36℃/96.8℉).
Tachypnoea (rapid breathing)
Tachycardia (rapid heartbeat)
Hypotension (low blood pressure)
Edema
Mottled skin
Dizziness
Confusion, sleepiness, lethargy and/or irritabilityIn some cases, an affected person may run a fever and their body temperature then drop to below 36℃/96.8℉ or vice versa. Medical assistance should be sought.In children, signs of sepsis include laboured breathing, listlessness, loss of appetite, floppiness, fretfulness, green or black vomit and irritability.Sepsis and septic shock can be fatal, particularly among children. If these signs appear, seek emergency medical help immediately.",[],[]
Acute Stress Disorder,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-stress-disorder/,,"Symptoms of acute stress disorder typically manifest immediately after a traumatic event. For a diagnosis of ASD to be made, they need to be present for between three and 30 days.[4]People who are affected by ASD tend to experience extreme feelings of terror and helplessness in reaction to the trauma[3] and may develop psychological and physical symptoms.The physical symptoms are typically caused by stress hormones such as adrenaline (epinephrine) and an overactivity of the nervous system. They may include:[1]Palpitations, i.e. a pounding heart
Difficulty breathing
Chest pain
Headache
Stomach pain
Nausea
SweatingThese symptoms usually develop within minutes or hours of the traumatic event and may clear within a few hours or days. However, in some cases the symptoms persist for weeks.Psychological symptoms of acute stress disorder include:[4]Arousal: Hypervigilance, an inability to focus, sleep disturbances, irritable mood and angry outbursts
Avoidance: Determination to avoid memories, people, feelings or places associated with the trauma
Dissociation: A sense of physical displacement, e.g. seeing oneself from outside one’s body, feeling dazed, experiencing an altered perception of time, difficulty remembering the event
Intrusion: Recurrent, involuntary flashbacks of the event, nightmares about the event
Negative mood: A generalized low mood, difficulty feeling and/or expressing positive emotionsASD versus PTSDMany of the symptoms of ASD are almost identical to those of PTSD. However, a diagnosis of PTSD will only be considered if the symptoms persist for more than 30 days or first appear more than one month after the trauma has occurred.Though many people who are diagnosed with ASD do not go on to develop PTSD, it is thought that having the former may increase a person’s risk of developing the latter. A prompt diagnosis of ASD can help people manage the condition and reduce the risk of them developing PTSD.[11][3]","Acute stress disorder can develop after a person, of any age, experiences or witnesses a deeply distressing or traumatic event – often one that is life-threatening or perceived as life-threatening. Examples include:[1][2][3][4]Natural disasters, such as floods, fires or earthquakes
Serious accidents
Physical or sexual assault, including domestic abuse
Combat
Terrorist attacks
Sudden death of a loved one
Receiving a life-threatening diagnosis
Facing a seemingly impossible challenge, e.g. related to one’s job or careerSeeing a traumatic event on television or in other media is not typically considered a trigger for ASD.[4]Risk factorsNot everyone who experiences trauma will develop ASD. A number of factors may increase the risk of a person developing the condition. These include:[4]Being female
A history of trauma
A history of mental health conditions
The severity of the traumatic event
Neurotic personality traits, e.g. experiencing the world as largely threatening, distressing and unsafe[12]
Avoidance as a coping mechanism","ASD can be diagnosed after symptoms have been experienced for at least three days. It is not possible to self-diagnose with ASD, as diagnosis requires an objective analysis of the symptoms of the affected person. If a person has experienced a traumatic event and thinks that they may have ASD, it is recommended that they visit a healthcare practitioner.
After taking the person’s history and performing a physical examination, a doctor will typically diagnose acute stress disorder using the following criteria.DSM-5 diagnostic criteriaTo diagnose ASD, a doctor may refer to the DSM 5 diagnostic criteria, the official diagnostic criteria as listed by the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). These are:[4]Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violation: In addition to directly witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event, it is possible for a person to be affected by ASD if they learn that a traumatic event happened to a close relative or friend or are exposed to traumatic events as part of their job.
Presenting symptoms: Of the five categories of symptoms for ASD – intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance and arousal – someone who is affected by ASD will present at least 9 of the 14 symptoms, from any of the categories.
Duration of the disturbance: The symptoms of ASD must last for at least three days in order for a diagnosis of ASD to be made. They must also manifest between at most three days and one month after the traumatic event took place.
Significant distress: The symptoms are debilitating enough to impact the person’s usual way of life, such as through impaired performance at work or the inability to participate normally in social activities.
Ruling out other causes: To make a diagnosis of ASD, the doctor must establish that a particular event is the root cause of the condition. They will, therefore, take care to identify any other possible causes, ruling out physical conditions, such as brain injury, or other psychological conditions. They will also consider whether the condition could be attributed to the effects of substances such as medication or alcohol.","Many people with ASD recover without any treatment. However, effective treatment options are available and may be recommended in cases where symptoms are severe or persistent.Treatment, which is primarily psychotherapy, sometimes combined with short-term use of medication, is aimed at alleviating symptoms and reducing the risk of the person subsequently developing PTSD.[13]If symptoms of ASD do not improve, a diagnosis of PTSD may be considered and the treatment plan revised accordingly.PsychotherapyWhile there are many different types of psychotherapy, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT) is the one recommended for the treatment of acute stress disorder. A timely course of TFCBT has been proven to reduce the likelihood of ASD developing into PTSD.[14][13]TFCBT helps people to become aware of and adjust unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors related to the trauma, thus aiding the recovery process. It is usually initiated no sooner than two weeks after the traumatic event, with six weekly sessions of 60 to 90 minutes.[13]MedicationMedication is not a first-line treatment for ASD, and the World Health Organization generally advises against the use of sleeping pills, as well as anti-anxiety drugs in the form of benzodiazepines, in the management of the condition.[2]If recommended at all, benzodiazepines such as clonazepam will typically be used only in low doses, for the short-term relief of severe anxiety and arousal symptoms. This type of medication carries risks of dependence if used long term and may also increase the risk of developing PTSD.[2][13]Beta-blockers, a class of medication that is not addictive, may be prescribed to alleviate some of the physical symptoms of ASD.[2] Other medications, including anti-depressants, are currently not recommended for the treatment of ASD.[13]",[],"Q: What are the symptoms of acute stress disorder in children?
A: If a child has experienced a traumatic event, it is important to monitor their behavior, as children are less likely than adults to recognize or self-report that they are experiencing symptoms of ASD. Difficulty sleeping, nightmares, repeated reenactment of the traumatic event through play, problems with concentration, detachment and irritability are all possible signs that a child is affected by ASD. If a caregiver suspects that a child may be experiencing ASD, it is recommended that they consult a health practitioner.[15]Q: How is acute stress disorder different to post-traumatic stress disorder?
A: Many of the symptoms of ASD are very similar to those of PTSD, a typically longer-term condition that can develop after a person experiences or witnesses a life-threatening, terrifying or otherwise deeply traumatic event. ASD is a short-term condition that can only be diagnosed between three days and one month after a traumatic event, and it is thought to have a somewhat broader range of triggers than PTSD. If symptoms of a stress reaction persist for more than 30 days or first appear more than one month after the trauma has occurred, a diagnosis of PTSD may be considered. While many people who are diagnosed with ASD do not go on to develop PTSD, it is thought that ASD may increase a person’s risk of developing PTSD.[7][11][3]Q: How is acute stress disorder different to adjustment disorder?
A: People affected by adjustment disorder may present symptoms similar to those of people affected by ASD. However, a major difference between ASD and adjustment disorder is related to the trigger of the condition. Whereas ASD is caused by a person experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event such as a car crash, natural disaster or sexual assault, adjustment disorder is triggered by a more broadly stressful, life-changing event or circumstance, such as the birth of a child, job loss, diagnosis with serious illness, marriage or the breakdown of a relationship. In addition, the reaction of the body’s nervous system tends to be less severe than in ASD. People affected by adjustment disorder typically recover within six months of no longer being exposed to the stressor.[16][17][18]"
Acute Varicella Zoster,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-varicella-zoster/,,"The typical symptom of chickenpox is the vesicular or blistering rash on the torso, scalp, face, arms, and legs. These spots generally become crusting sores. There may also be blisters or sore inside the mouth and nose. This rash is often extremely itchy. Teenagers and adults may have flu-like symptoms before the rash appears. People with chickenpox are infective 1-2 days before the development of rash.",[],The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms and the appearance of the blister. Testing fluid from the blistering rash for the Varicella zoster virus can confirm the diagnosis.,"No specific treatment is recommended for children with chickenpox. Lotions to help reduce itching might be helpful. Adults, people with weakened immune systems and people who develop complications should have anti-viral medication. [Pregnant women who are exposed to chickenpox]((/conditions/pregnancy-complications/) also need treatment, and should discuss this with their treating doctor.","Vaccination against the Varicella zoster virus is part of the regular vaccination schedule. Keeping to the recommended vaccination schedule can prevent many cases of chickenpox. Adults who have never had chickenpox and who have never been vaccinated against chickenpox should consider vaccination, especially if they work or live with children. Women who have never had chickenpox should consider vaccination before becoming pregnant.",[]
Adjustment Disorder,https://ada.com/conditions/adjustment-disorder/,,"The symptoms of adjustment disorder will usually appear within three months of the stressful event or life change and disappear within six months. If adjustment disorder does not resolve after this time, a new diagnosis will be considered. Most commonly, adjustment disorder which does not resolve develops into depression.Generally, the symptoms will significantly interfere with the functioning of an individual's life, for example by making it difficult to socialize, work or attend school.Symptoms of adjustment disorder vary according to the age of the person experiencing the condition. Children and adolescents are more likely to display behavioral symptoms, such as acting out, whereas adults tend to experience more emotional symptoms, such as anxiety and a depressed mood.[3]There are six subtypes of adjustment disorder, each with its own specific set of symptoms:[4]Adjustment disorder with depressed mood: Symptoms may include feelings of depression, sadness and hopelessness. Individuals may also be highly tearful and experience bouts of crying.
Adjustment disorder with anxiety: Symptoms may include feelings of nervousness, apprehension and worry. Individuals may also be excessively jittery and fearful of separation, from parents or other significant people.
Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood: An individual will experience a mixture of the symptoms listed in both subtypes above.
Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct: An individual will experience a change in behavior, typically characterized by a lack of respect for the rights and feelings of others, as well as a lack of respect for social norms and rules.
Adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct: An individual will experience a combination of all the symptoms listed above.
Adjustment disorder unspecified: An individual experiences a severe reaction to a stressor, but it does not fit into any of the above categories. Symptoms may include social withdrawal and introversion.People experiencing symtoms of adjustment disorder should receive a psychological evaluation from a psychiatrist or other mental health professional. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.","Adjustment disorder is a reaction to a particular stressor, whether a stressful life event or a major life change. There is no clear way to identify why some people develop adjustment disorder and why some do not, with things such as a person’s coping skills, past experiences and social skills all thought to play a role.Common stressors that may lead to adjustment disorder in a person of any age include:[5]Giving birth
Marriage
Mobbing
Unemployment
Retirement
Divorce or relationship problems
Illness
Moving to a new house or new location
Financial difficulties
The death of a loved oneCommon stressors in children and young adults include:Parental divorce or separation
Problems at school, bullying, for example
Sexuality issues
Parental neglect","A diagnosis of adjustment disorder usually requires a full psychological evaluation by a psychiatrist or other mental health professional. This evaluation will typically take into account past experiences, behaviors, emotions and sources of stress, among other factors. When diagnosing children or adolescents, parents may also be present during the evaluation.[6]The key criteria for diagnosing adjustment disorder are:The symptoms must have begun to appear within three months of the stressor occurring.
The condition must be characterized by stress that is in excess of what would be considered normal under the circumstances.
The symptoms must be distinct from similar disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.","The chosen treatment method for adjustment disorder will usually depend on a variety of factors, including:[7]Age
Severity of symptoms
The subtype being experienced
Specific factors ‒ the likely outcome of the stressor, for exampleTaking these factors into consideration, a psychiatrist or other mental health professional will recommend a treatment route.[8][9]Individual psychotherapyIndividual psychotherapy will usually take a cognitive-behavioral approach and – because the condition is defined as short-term – will typically be solution-focussed, i.e.designed to better equip the individual to deal with their particular life problem.Family therapyFamily therapy will generally be recommended in cases of childhood or adolescent adjustment disorder. It is designed to overcome conflicts in family life and improve communication skills among family members. It may also be useful in teaching family members how to support the child/adolescent who is experiencing adjustment disorder.Group therapyIn some cases, discussing the disorder and sharing coping techniques with a group of people also experiencing adjustment disorder may be a useful treatment method. Group therapy can also help the person improve their communication skills and can be a useful source of support and encouragement.[10]MedicationMedication is generally not prescribed in cases of adjustment disorder.",There is no known way to prevent the onset of adjustment disorder. Identifying the condition early and seeking professional help can be effective in reducing the severity of adjustment disorder and improving general wellbeing.,"Q: What is the difference between adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?
A: Although adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can have overlapping symptoms, the key difference between the two conditions is their cause. Adjustment disorder is typically triggered by a stressful event or phase, but one that is within the normal range of human experience, such as a marriage breakup or financial difficulty. Conversely, PTSD is triggered by an exceptional event, normally one involving the threat of death, serious injury or violence, that causes feelings of extreme fear, horror and helplessness. PTSD can also be a long-term condition that may not present itself for several months or years after the initial event. Adjustment disorder, on the other hand, must present itself within three months of the triggering event.[11]Q: What is the difference between adjustment disorder and depression?
A: Adjustment disorder – especially the depressed mood subtype – and depression are similar conditions that can only be accurately differentiated by a doctor or other medical professional. It is generally thought that the major difference between the two conditions is that adjustment disorder is triggered by an identifiable stressful event or phase, whereas depression is more generalized, making it unclear what exactly is causing the condition. Adjustment disorder will also generally be a short-term condition.Good to know: If a person who has been diagnosed with adjustment disorder continues to experience mental distress after six months, it is likely that the AD has developed into another mental health condition, most commonly depression. In this event, a new diagnosis will be considered. Other conditions developing from AD are usually anticipated to be longer-lasting and to require ongoing treatment. [12][13]"
Alcohol Intoxication,https://ada.com/conditions/alcohol-intoxication/,,"The symptoms depend on the level of alcohol in the blood, and whether the individual drinks alcohol regularly.Early symptoms of alcohol intoxication include:A rapid heart beat
A feeling of well-being and confidence
Reddening of the skin
An unsteady gaitSymptoms of worsening intoxication include:Disinhibition
Nausea
Vomiting
Reduced attentiveness
Slurred speech
Loss of control of body movements
Sleepiness
Loss of consciousness (blackouts)People with very severe intoxication may become very cold, dehydrated and may develop seizures.The symptoms of ethanol intoxication change, depending on how many milligrams of alcohol have been consumed.Symptoms of mild alcohol intoxication, between 20 mg and 50 mg, include:[2][3]Talkativeness
A feeling of tranquility and relaxation
Impairment in tasks requiring skill and/or fine motor coordination
Mild feelings of sedationSymptoms of moderate alcohol intoxication, between 50 mg and 200 mg, include:[2][3]Increasing trouble with fine motor coordination
Impaired judgement
Altered perceptions of the environment around them
Changes in mood, behaviour and personality, and loss of inhibitions
Memory impairments
Slowed reaction time
Slurred speech
Clumsiness and unsteady gait
Uncontrolled eye movementsSymptoms of serious alcohol intoxication, also known as alcohol poisoning, between 200 mg upward, include:[2][3]Nausea and vomiting
Dizziness
Problems speaking and articulating
Double vision
Amnesia
Delirium
Hypothermia, or feeling very cold
Lethargy
Respiratory depression
Seizures
Coma
DeathIn people who are alcohol-naive, meaning that they do not regularly consume alcohol, a level of 400mg or above may be fatal. People who habitually consume alcohol and people with alcoholism can consume relatively more alcohol and therefore have higher blood alcohol levels (BAC levels), without displaying symptoms of intoxication than can people who do not consume much alcohol. However, symptoms and risk will always be present in some form.Good to know: Alcohol poisoning can cause sudden death due to respiratory depression and heart arrhythmia.[3] This is particularly true if the intoxicated person is asleep, or falls asleep or unconscious.People observing the intoxicated person may notice the following symptoms:[2][6]Smell of alcohol on breath or clothing
Enlarged pupils
Redness of the face
Vomiting
Incoherence
Slow breathing
Faster-than-usual eye movements
Lack of alertness
Semi-consciousness or lack of responsiveness
Incoherent speechSome symptoms of alcohol poisoning need immediate emergency medical attention. These include:[6]Breathing problems
Uncontrollable vomiting
Seizures
Chest painGood to know: Moderate or serious alcohol intoxication can cause the affected person to lose alertness or become semi-conscious and can also cause vomiting. Therefore, it is important to monitor them to minimise the risk of aspiration, or inhalation, of vomit.[3] Aspirated vomit can cause death through suffocation, or can lead to bacterial infection of the lungs. To minimize the risk of vomit being aspirated, place the affected person in the recovery position, in which the person is placed on their side, facing slightly downwards, supported by bent limbs. A person in this condition must be monitored, and their caregivers should seek emergency medical help for them immediately.",[],"Good to know: If it is suspected that the person who has alcohol intoxication has consumed methanol, isopropanol or ethylene glycol rather than ethanol, an effort should be made to find out which one it was, as the treatment recommended in cases of  methanol or ethylene glycol intoxication is different to that which is carried out for ethanol (see FAQs).The diagnosis is usually made by considering the symptoms of the affected person and a physical examination. Alcohol levels can be measured in the blood or in the breath with a breathalyzer machine.If doctors suspect that the affected person may be injured or have an underlying condition that is worsening the symptoms, other examinations may be carried out. Tests may be done, including X-rays or CT scans to check  for fractures from falls and/or blows to head. Fingerstick tests for blood glucose should also be done, as the symptoms of severe hypoglycemia resemble those of alcohol intoxication.[3]Other disorders with symptoms that may be mistaken for alcohol intoxication include:[2]Intoxication from recreational drugs, such as cocaine or opiates, or prescription drugs such as benzodiazepine or barbiturates.
Carbon monoxide poisoning
Hypoglycemia, low blood sugar
Ketoacidosis, or high levels of acid in the blood

People who are mildly or moderately intoxicated will eventually process the alcohol, and will get better with time. Antiemetic drugs may be administered.People with severe alcohol intoxication may need medical assessment or hospitalization to receive fluids through an IV line (a drip) and to manage any complications, such as seizures or difficulty breathing. In severe cases, the intoxicated person may need breathing support by intubation and ventilation.","Alcohol intoxication can be avoided by drinking alcohol moderately or not at all. Strategies that help avoid alcohol intoxication include alternating alcoholic drinks with non-alcoholic drinks (ideally water), counting drinks, choosing beverages with lower alcohol content and eating a solid meal before drinking alcohol.",[]
Alcohol Withdrawal,https://ada.com/conditions/alcohol-withdrawal/,,"The symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can be divided into two types: physical and psychological.Physical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include:[3][4]Hand tremors (shaking)
Nausea
Thirstiness
Dry mouth
Abdominal pain
Headache
Increased sweating
Fever / increased body temperature
Excessive, purposeless physical activity
Hyperventilation (rapid breathing)
High blood pressure
Tachycardia (fast heart rate, with a pulse greater than 100 beats per minute)
Seizures, in severe casesPsychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include:Depression
Anxiety
Irritability and mood swings
Sleep disturbances, including frequent awakening, restless sleep, insomnia and night terrors
Confusion
Transient tactile, visual or auditory hallucinations or illusions
Poor focus
RestlessnessIf an individual ceases to consume alcohol, most of these symptoms will decrease significantly after 10 days, but some might be present for longer.People experiencing possible symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.Alcohol withdrawal timelineThe stages of alcohol withdrawal can be roughly broken down into three stages:Stage 1 (8 hours after last drink): Anxiety, insomnia, abdominal pain and nausea are typically experienced during the first stage.
Stage 2 (24-72 hours after last drink): High blood pressure, high body temperature, unusually increased heart rate, rapid breathing and confusion are typical of this stage.
Stage 3 (72+ hours after last drink): Hallucinations, fever, agitation and seizures are typical of this stage.This is a rough timeline – some individuals may experience a different timeline with differing symptoms.Delirium tremensDelirium tremens refers to a severe reaction to alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms will generally begin after around two to three days of ceasing drinking and may include:[5]Severe trembling and agitation
Heavy sweating
Increased heart rate
Nightmares
Global confusion
Disorientation
Visual and auditory hallucinations
Fever
High blood pressure
Convulsions, in rare casesThese symptoms may appear suddenly, but they typically develop two to three days after the affected person stops drinking and are at their worst on the fourth or fifth day. Dehydration can also make delirium tremens worse. It is a serious condition which can in some cases be fatal. If any of these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention should be sought. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.There are several factors that make the development of delirium tremens more likely. These include:A history of heavy drinking
A history of delirium tremens
Being over the age of 30
Having another illness
Developing alcohol withdrawal after two or more days","The symptoms of alcohol withdrawal occur when a period of sustained and heavy alcohol consumption suddenly stops. Most people who experience alcohol withdrawal have an alcohol dependency.Alcohol affects the part of the brain responsible for the fight-or-flight response. Alcohol suppresses this response, making us relaxed. When withdrawing from alcohol use, the chemical balance of the brain is adjusted, meaning individual’s enter this fight-or-flight state, even without the presence of danger. It is this state that causes both the physical and psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.[6]","A doctor will typically be able to diagnose alcohol withdrawal, after an individual answers a series of questions about their drinking habits and the symptoms which are being experienced, and once a physical examination has been performed.","Alcohol withdrawal requires both short-term and long-term treatment. The short-term treatment relates to managing a person’s physical and mental reactions to stopping drinking alcohol, and long-term treatment focuses on providing support to help a person maintain their abstinence.Short-term treatmentThe first step in treating alcohol withdrawal will typically involve helping the affected person as they undergo a process of alcohol detoxification, commonly referred to as detox. This will usually be a supervised process, undertaken at a specialised treatment centre, in which individuals are helped to overcome the symptoms that may result from alcohol withdrawal. See the “Symptoms” section of this resource, above, for more information.During the detox, people are recommended to:Drink plenty of fluids
Eat regularlyDoctors will prescribe vitamin B1 (thiamine) in all cases of alcohol withdrawal. A deficiency of this vitamin affects around 80 percent of people who have experienced prolonged alcohol exposure.If a person is experiencing particularly strong symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, medications may be prescribed. The medications most commonly prescribed to help alleviate the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are called benzodiazepines. These can help prevent minor alcohol withdrawal symptoms from becoming worse, e.g. in people for whom delirium tremens is considered to be a risk. Medications are not usually part of a typical first-line treatment plan for alcohol withdrawal, and these medications will be administered at the discretion of the medical professionals who monitor the detox process.The second step in treating alcohol withdrawal involves psychological evaluation to identify the underlying causes of a person’s alcohol dependency. These causes may be psychological, physical, biochemical and/or social. Doctors will work with the affected person to identify these causes and to devise a long-term treatment plan tailored to their needs in order to help them remain abstinent from alcohol on a long-term basis.Long-term treatmentAfter the detox, people with a severe alcohol dependence will require the assistance of a qualified treatment centre, a rehabilitation centre, to help them recover from alcohol dependency. This period, which can last weeks or months, can be experienced as an inpatient or an outpatient, depending on the needs of the affected person. Most people with mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms will find treatment as an outpatient sufficient.[7]To help people recover in the long-term, treatment centres will also provide advice on how to overcome alcohol dependency and on self-care and establishing living habits that promote their overall health and happiness. A person recovering from alcohol dependency may also be advised to attend support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous to help them remain abstinent from alcohol.","Alcohol withdrawal is caused by prolonged exposure to large amounts of alcohol and can therefore be prevented through limiting one’s exposure to alcohol, so as not to develop an alcohol dependency. Methods of doing this include:Quitting alcohol completely
Having frequent alcohol-free periods (days, weeks or months)
Not exceeding the recommended daily intake guidelines for alcohol. According to the US Department of Health, this is 1 drink per day for women and 2 drinks per day for men.","Q: Is there a difference between alcohol withdrawal and a hangover?
A: Yes. Although the effects of a hangover are sometimes compared to mild alcohol withdrawal, there is a difference between the two. Alcohol withdrawal is a physical reaction to stopping drinking after prolonged and heavy consumption. People experiencing alcohol withdrawal will also typically be dependent on alcohol. A hangover, on the other hand, can be experienced by anyone, typically after a single bout of drinking alcohol. Alcohol withdrawal is a serious condition that can lead to acute and chronic complications, whereas a hangover is  non-serious in the majority of cases.[4][8]Q: How long does alcohol withdrawal last?
A: The symptoms of alcohol withdrawal will typically begin to subside after 10 days in most cases. The timeline of alcohol withdrawal can be roughly split into three stages, with differing symptoms in each (see: the alcohol withdrawal timeline). The affected person should maintain their abstinence from alcohol for the rest of their lifetime, seeking help from available services whenever they feel the need to consume alcohol."
Allergic Conjunctivitis,https://ada.com/conditions/allergic-conjunctivitis/,,"Generally, allergic conjunctivitis is bilateral, meaning that it affects both eyes. Symptoms tend to develop quickly, and one eye may be more severely affected than the other. Rubbing the eyes may make symptoms worse.Symptoms include:[1][2][3][4][9]Pinkness or redness of the eyes
Burning, intense itching or a sensation of grittiness in the eyes
Watering of the eyes; the discharge is clear
Swollen eyelids, which are red on the inside
Slight sensitivity to bright light
Other symptoms of allergy, e.g. itchy nose, sneezing and scratchy throatDepending on the cause and type of allergic conjunctivitis, there may be other symptoms and signs.Pain is not typically a symptom of allergic conjunctivitis. If it does occur, it tends to be mild. Furthermore, a person’s vision is not usually affected. Severe eye pain may indicate another, more serious condition such as glaucoma, and, if present, medical attention should be sought promptly.If any symptoms affecting the eyes are severe or vision is impaired, it is important to contact a doctor without delay.","A person’s immune system may be sensitive to certain substances such as pollen or molds. These are called allergens and, if they enter the eye, allergic conjunctivitis can result.[4][9]The most common causes of allergic conjunctivitis are the following types of allergens:[1][4][9]Pollens, including grass, tree and other plant pollens
Molds
Dust mites
Animal dander, e.g. pet furLess common causes of allergic reactions include contact lenses, makeup, eye drops and other substances used in or near the eyes.","When symptoms are mild, a diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis can often be made without seeing a doctor, and the condition can be treated at home. However, if there is any uncertainty or concern over the condition or the symptoms are severe, seeing a doctor is very important.A doctor will take the person’s medical history and ask whether they have any allergies. They will examine the eyes and assess the signs and symptoms present, taking care to rule out acute viral conjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, dry eye syndrome and other more serious eye conditions, such as uveitis and keratitis.[2][13]In most cases, it will not be necessary to perform any special tests. However, in some cases a doctor will order allergy tests, e.g. skin patch tests, to identify allergens and confirm the diagnosis.[3]","Mild cases of allergic conjunctivitis often clear up when exposure to the allergen is reduced, without special medical treatment. In more serious or long-lasting cases, medication may be necessary to treat the condition.Home remedies for allergic conjunctivitisThe following home remedies and over-the-counter treatments may help to relieve the discomfort caused by conjunctivitis:[1][3]Taking steps to minimize contact with the allergen
Applying lubricating eye drops, called artificial tears  to the eye; these are available without a prescription
Applying a cold compress to the eye, i.e. a clean cloth that has been soaked in water
Avoiding rubbing the eyes
Avoiding the use of contact lenses until the conjunctivitis has cleared
Avoiding the use of eye makeup until the conjunctivitis has clearedA person with perennial allergic conjunctivitis may wish to consult an allergy specialist to identify the cause of their allergic condition and devise an approach to minimize exposure.[9]Allergic conjunctivitis medicationWhen allergic conjunctivitis is more serious or does not clear up, medication may be recommended to calm the allergic reaction, provide relief from symptoms and prevent eye complications. Medication may include:[4][9]Eye dropsEye drops are generally available over the counter for short-term daily use of two weeks or less, or with a prescription for longer-term use. The types of eye drops recommended for allergic conjunctivitis typically contain antihistamines or mast cell stabilizers. Both histamines and mast cells are involved in an allergic reaction; antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers function to reduce their effects and thereby the severity of the reaction.Oral medicationAntihistamine tablets are sometimes recommended for allergic conjunctivitis. They can also help to alleviate other symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as a runny nose caused by hay fever. Antihistamines can cause drowsiness, so they may not be suitable for everyone.Steroid medicationIn very severe cases, corticosteroids may be prescribed. This may take the form of:Steroid eye drops
Steroid tablets
Steroid injectionsWhile they are very effective, corticosteroids can cause serious side-effects and complications, so they are rarely used to treat allergic conjunctivitis.If symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are severe or do not improve with treatment, it is important to seek medical advice.If a person has vernal keratoconjunctivitis or atopic conjunctivitis, they will be referred to an ophthalmologist, a specialist eye doctor, for specialized treatment.","While it may not be possible to prevent an episode of allergic conjunctivitis, taking steps to limit exposure to known allergens, such as pollen, dust, mold or certain soaps, can help to minimize the likelihood and severity of its occurrence. For example, this may include:[4][15]Keeping windows closed and wearing wraparound sunglasses when outside during hay fever season
Keeping the house as free of dust and mold as possible and using an air purifier
Using hypoallergenic soaps and cosmetics","Q: Is allergic conjunctivitis contagious?
A: No, allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious.[2] Unlike viral conjunctivitis, which is caused by a virus, and bacterial conjunctivitis, which is caused by bacteria, allergic conjunctivitis cannot be spread to other people. It is the result of a specific person’s reaction to allergens which they are sensitive to, such as dust or seasonal pollen,.Q: Bacterial conjunctivitis vs. allergic conjunctivitis – what is the difference?
A: Bacterial conjunctivitis is pink eye that is caused by an infection of the eye(s) with bacteria. Allergic conjunctivitis is pink eye that is caused by allergens which irritate the eye(s). Some of the symptoms and treatments are different; antibiotic medications may be prescribed to treat bacterial conjunctivitis in severe cases of infection.Q: Allergic conjunctivitis vs. pink eye – what is the difference?
A: Pink eye is the common term for all types of conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis is one type of pink eye and refers to pink eye that is caused by allergens. Other types of pink eye include viral conjunctivitis and bacterial conjunctivitis."
Allergic Rhinitis,https://ada.com/conditions/allergic-rhinitis/,,"The typical symptoms of allergic rhinitis is a stuffy, runny or itchy nose with itchy, teary eyes. Some people may develop a cough, sore throat, headaches, or hives. Some people find that their symptoms disturb their sleep, which causes them to have poor concentration, and to feel tired or sleepy during the day time.",[],"The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms. If the substance causing the symptoms is unknown, a skin or blood allergy test may help to identify the cause.","Treatment is usually directed by the severity of the allergic symptoms. Common options include eye drops, medicated nasal sprays and antihistamine medications. Nasal sprays or medications containing a decongestant are often helpful in reducing symptoms. In severe cases, or if it is impossible to avoid the trigger, a doctor may recommend immunotherapy. This is a slow exposure to the allergen, helping the body get used to it and reducing future immune responses to the allergen.",Avoiding known triggers may help to prevent the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Some people take anti-histamine medications to avoid symptoms at times when they know they can not avoid their trigger (i.e. in spring when pollen is in the air).,[]
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),https://ada.com/conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/,,"Early symptoms of ALS can be different from person to person, and include weakness and tingling in the arms and legs, muscle cramps and stiffness and sometimes voice changes or difficulty swallowing. People with ALS may find that they have difficulty controlling their emotions. As the condition progresses, the muscles become stiff and smaller, and people with ALS eventually lose their ability to move independently, to talk and to swallow and breathe.",[],"Diagnosis is made by evaluating the symptoms, and undergoing a physical examination by a neurologist. There is no single diagnostic test for ALS. However, several tests may be used to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms. These include blood tests, scans (usually an MRI), nerve testing, investigating the fluid around the spinal cord (lumbar puncture) and, in rare cases, muscle biopsy.","There is no cure for ALS. There is a medication which can slow the progression of the disease, but the benefit of this can be different from person to person, and should be discussed with a neurologist. The management of ALS requires therapists from multiple areas to help maintain ability for as long as possible and to support a person physically, socially and emotionally. Eventually, breathing and eating can be replaced with feeding tubes or machines, but this is guided by individual beliefs and preferences.",[],[]
Anal Cancer,https://ada.com/conditions/anal-cancer/,,"Early symptoms of anal cancer include bleeding from around the anus, a lump in or near the anus, anal itching and discharge from the anus. Other symptoms may include anal pain, a change in bowel habits, and swollen lymph nodes in the groin and anal region.",[],"Diagnosis is usually made by examining the area and undergoing a digital rectal exam, where a doctor gently feels the inside of the anus for any lumps. This test is often useful in detecting early cancer. Other tests that may be helpful are endoscopy (flexible camera) of the anus and rectum and ultrasound of the anal region. A small sample (a biopsy) of any growths will be taken and tested to see if cancer is present. If any of these tests are positive for cancer, further investigation is done to confirm the staging of the cancer.","The treatment of anal cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, anal cancer can be treated by radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy or a combination of therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment.","Practicing safe sex can help to prevent some cases of anal cancer. Quitting smoking may also be helpful. Vaccination against the human papillomavirus may prevent some cases of anal cancer, if a person has never had the virus before. Having routine digital rectal exams can help detect anal cancer before symptoms occur.",[]
Anal Fissure,https://ada.com/conditions/anal-fissure/,,"The most common anal fissure symptoms may include:[4][5]A sharp, searing or burning pain in or around the bottom, which tends to be worse when passing feces and for about an hour or so afterwards
Some bleeding, usually bright red on the toilet paper or stool
ItchingGood to know: A person with an anal fissure often puts off defecation, leading to a worsening cycle in which stools dry and harden, leading to further constipation and anal pain.[3]Less common anal fissure symptoms may include:[6][7]Spasms or a tightening feeling in the anus when feces is excreted
A sentinel pile, a tag of skin which sometimes develops on the edge of the anus, below the fissure
Abscesses, a painful boil-like swelling near the anus filled with pus, which may lead to a fistula, a connection to the external skin, which may have a foul-smelling mucus discharge","An anal fissure can occur when there is overstretching of the anal canal, which causes the lining to tear. Subsequent defecation stretches the area, meaning that healing is hindered. The anal sphincter may spasm as a result of anal fissure, restricting blood supply to the area and further hindering the healing process. In children especially, putting off defecation to avoid the associated pain may worsen constipation and exacerbate the problem.Anal fissure may be classed as:Acute anal fissure, which clears up within six weeks. This is the most common type, and normally appears as linear with clear edges.
Chronic anal fissure, which persists for more than six weeks. Chronic anal fissure healing time varies. Without treatment, it is possible to have an anal fissure for years.A chronic fissure is usually deeper than an acute anal fissure and is often associated with an external skin tag. Chronic fissure is usually treatable, but recurrence of the fissure after treatment is common.[1]An anal fissure may also be classed as:[4]Primary: having no apparent cause
Secondary: due to an underlying condition, such as constipation, or resulting from pregnancy or childbirthConstipationAnal fissure most commonly occurs due to constipation. Lots of factors may cause constipation, but the most common include:[5][8]Not eating enough fiber
Not drinking enough fluids.
Some medications, particularly strong painkillers, such as opioids.
Not exercising or being less active
Frequently ignoring the urge to defecate
Changing diet or daily routine
Anxiety or depression
Some medical conditions, such as an underactive thyroid glandFor information about persistent constipation and its possible treatments, see this resource on chronic idiopathic constipation.Anal fissure postpartumAnal fissure can occur in pregnancy. During pregnancy, women often experience constipation due to the increased weight of the baby putting pressure on the rectum, the final segment of the digestive system, which stores feces until a person is ready to defecate.Childbirth causes anal fissure in about one in 10 women.Other anal fissure causesOther possible causes of anal fissure include:[4][9]Persistent diarrhea
A sexually transmitted infection, such as anal herpes, which causes the tissues to become soft and fragile
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease
Trauma, for instance from anal intercourse or other insertion of foreign objects
Unusually tight anal sphincter musclesOften, no clear cause for anal fissure can be found. They are associated with tight anal sphincter muscles, though the cause of this is unknown.","A doctor may diagnose anal fissure based on description of the symptoms and a physical examination.The physical examination usually involves gently separating the buttocks to allow a doctor to see the area around the anus.Most fissures appear in the 12 or 6 o’clock position. Those in other locations are likely to be associated with an underlying disorder, such as Crohn’s disease.A doctor will usually avoid inserting anything into the anus, such as a gloved finger or small instrument, as this can cause substantial pain and is often unnecessary for provisional diagnosis.[3]Anal fissure anoscopy, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopyIf the diagnosis is unclear, an anoscopy may be recommended. This involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera on the end into the anus to look for symptom causes in the intestine. However, anoscopy is avoided in cases of an acute anal fissure as it is normally not well tolerated. Often, the patient is at first treated solely on the basis of symptoms. Sometimes, topical anaesthetic is used to facilitate an anoscopy.Those who have a chronic or recurrent anal fissure after surgical therapy may be evaluated further with anoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, a procedure similar to anoscopy, but which also examines the lower colon.[10]Sometimes, a colonoscopy procedure is used to look for the presence of an underlying condition that may be causing an anal fissure, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBD). This is similar to an anoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, but which also examines the entire colon.See this resource for information on preparing for a colonoscopy.Good to know: Anal fissures are sometimes misdiagnosed as hemorrhoids, delaying appropriate treatment, which may lead to an acute fissure becoming a chronic one, which is more difficult to treat. Wrong diagnosis of anal fissure may also allow other conditions to go undetected and untreated, such as infection and, though it is rare, anal cancer.[11]","Treatment of an anal fissure primarily aims to ease the painTreatment begins with changing to a high-fiber diet, as well as maintaining sufficient fluid intake to soften feces and prevent further damage to the area while the wound is healing. Pain medication will also be given.Usually, an anal fissure will heal with home treatment. In the case of chronic anal fissure, occasionally surgery will be recommended.Anal fissure medicineAnal fissure pain relief and other medicines may include:[9][12]Anesthetic cream or ointmentThis should be applied before going to the toilet. Anesthetic creams and ointments can be obtained by prescription, though some products are available without. Anesthetic should only be used for short periods of up to about five to seven days, otherwise the skin around the anus may become irritated.Steroid cream or ointmentSteroids may be recommended to ease swelling if it is severe. This may help to relieve pain and any itching. Steroids should not be used for more than one week at a time.[5]PainkillersIbuprofen and paracetamol can help to ease pain. Opioids should be avoided, as this can cause constipation.Stool softeningAn anal fissure will heal more easily if feces is kept soft, so that it can pass more easily. A diet involving plenty of high fiber foods will help, such as fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds.Stool softening medication may also be obtained on prescription or bought at pharmacies.Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) ointmentThese medications may be prescribed for chronic anal fissures, present for six weeks or more. This is applied to the skin to reduce the anal sphincter pressure and can decrease pain and facilitate further healing. Side effects include headache, so the correct amount must be used.Anal fissure home treatmentOther general measures that are recommended alongside medicine for anal fissure may include:[4][9]Washing the area carefully with water after using the toilet, to avoid irritation and infection. Soap should be avoided as this may cause irritation, and the area should be gently dried.
Sitz baths for anal fissure may be recommended as they are thought to soothe and relax the anus muscles, relieving some of the painful internal sphincter muscle spasm. This involves sitting in plain, non-soapy water after defecation.Measures to avoid constipation and keep feces soft may include:[5][8]Eating plenty of fiber, such as is found in fruit, vegetables, cereals, wholemeal bread
Drinking plenty of liquids to soften stools. Adults should aim to drink two litres or more each day. It is best to avoid alcoholic drinks as they can cause dehydration.
Not putting off defecation, which can lead to bigger and harder stools forming, which may exacerbate the problemAnal fissure surgery and injectionsThere are further clinical treatments available for people who do not respond to topical therapy and home treatment measures. These may include:[5][12]Botulinum toxinAlso known as botox, this compound, which temporarily paralyzes muscles for up to three months, can be injected into the anal sphincter. This may be done without anesthesia or sedation. This may lead to temporary, mild anal leakage of gas or feces.SurgeryThe surgery recommended for treating an anal fissure is normally sphincterotomy, which aims to relax the anal sphincter by cutting the muscle in order to loosen the anal muscle, therefore improving blood supply and aiding healing. Incontinence is a possible complication from surgery, so it is only offered to people whose symptoms have persisted despite medicine for at least one to three months. Anal fissure surgery recovery time varies from person to person.",[],"Q: Are there home remedies for anal fissure?
A: Yes, there are several measures for home treatment which may help. These include:Sitz bath or hip bath, which involves sitting in plain, non-soapy water after defecation to keep the area clean
Sitting on a warm heating pad or warm water bottle is thought to promote healing as heat increases blood flow to the areaHowever, medical attention should always be sought where there is bleeding from the anus. It may indicate other conditions which must receive prompt treatment to ensure the best outcome, such as anal cancer.Q: Anal fissure or herpes - which do I have?
A: It is possible to get Herpes, a sexually transmitted infection, in the anal area. This can bring about what feels like a fissure around the anus and may be mistaken for one. Anal fissure causes burning pain and bleeding during defecation. Herpes causes blisters, itching and pain around the anus, but not especially while defecating, and lesions from herpes are unlikely to bleed.Herpes may cause flu-like symptoms and other associated problems such as pain with urination. Anal herpes normally has a history of sexual exposure to the herpes virus."
Anaphylaxis,https://ada.com/conditions/anaphylaxis/,,"The symptoms of anaphylaxis can come on, progress and become life-threatening very quickly. The most common early symptoms of anaphylaxis include:[2][3]Itchy skin, sometimes developing into hives, a rash of raised, pink or red areas known as wheals
Wheezing, hoarseness and chest tightness
Swelling of the lips, tongue and throat, known as angioedema
Swelling of eyes, hands and feet
Reddening of the skin
Irritation and inflammation of the eyes and nasal passagesAs anaphylactic shock progresses, other symptoms may include:[2][4]A sense of impending doom
A fast or thumping heart
Stomach cramps, nausea and vomitingAdvanced symptoms of anaphylaxis include:[2][4]A high-pitched wheezing sound, known as stridor
Fast, shallow breathing or complete inability to breathe
Bluish skin on the lips and tongue
Confusion, agitation and anxiety
A sudden feeling of weakness or dizziness
Loss of consciousness","Anaphylaxis is an extreme allergic response. Allergies occur when the immune system overreacts to a substance that it wrongly perceives as a threat. These substances are called allergens or triggers. Some people are sensitive to one or more allergens. Even a minute amount of an allergen can trigger an allergic reaction.[5]In the case of anaphylaxis, the body’s allergic reaction goes into overdrive. The cells of the body release chemical substances which cause swelling in different areas. This sets off a series of events which cause the body to lose control of its vital functions, the respiratory and/or cardiovascular system.In anaphylactic shock, the blood vessels widen, which leads to a drop in blood pressure. The tissues in the airways swell, which causes difficulty breathing and may completely block the airways. If air cannot be taken into the lungs, the blood cannot be oxygenated. Oxygenated blood is needed so that the cells of organs, such as the brain, can work. The heart muscle needs oxygen so that it can pump blood around the body. Once one major organ system starts to falter, the others become strained, potentially leading to failure of multiple organs and mortality.[4]Anaphylaxis triggersThe trigger for anaphylactic shock reactions vary from person to person. Some of the most common triggers include:[6][7]Certain foods, including nuts, shellfish, eggs, some fruits
Insect stings, particularly wasp stings and bee stings
Natural latex, also known as rubber, such as is found in condoms
Certain medications, including some antibiotics such as penicillin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g. aspirin
General anaesthetic
Contrast agents: special dyes used in some medical testsMany cases of anaphylaxis have no known cause. This is called idiopathic anaphylaxis.Risk factors for anaphylaxisThere aren’t many known risk factors for anaphylaxis, but some factors that may increase risk include:[8]Previous anaphylaxis
Allergies or asthma
Certain other conditions, including mastocytosis, an abnormal accumulation of mast cells, which release histamine and other substances during allergic reactionsTypes of anaphylactic reactionAnaphylactic reactions may be divided into two main types:[2]Uniphasic reactions have symptoms that get rapidly worse, but once treated, the symptoms go and then do not return.
Biphasic reactions may be mild or severe to start with and then appear to disappear before symptoms increase, with breathing and blood pressure problems.","The diagnosis is based on the recognition of symptoms occurring quickly and rapidly worsening. Treatment is not delayed in order to carry out further diagnostic tests, since an anaphylactic reaction is an emergency, and anyone with presumed anaphylaxis is treated as such.After life-saving emergency treatment has been started and symptoms have been brought under control, a blood test can be done to identify anaphylaxis or rule out other causes of the symptoms. The blood test should be done as soon as possible and no later than four hours from the onset of symptoms. It measures mast cell tryptase, a chemical released by the immune system in a severe allergic reaction.[4][9]","Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency and needs immediate treatment. Out of hospital, an ambulance must be called at once and the patient transported to an emergency department.[4]First aid measuresWhile waiting for medical attention, first aid measures should be implemented immediately, including:[4][10]AdrenalineAdrenaline should be injected immediately, where possible. Many people who are susceptible to anaphylaxis will carry an adrenaline auto-injector, also known as an adrenaline pen or epinephrine. This is a pre-filled syringe with a needle, that can be injected by the person having the anaphylactic reaction or by a bystander who knows how to use it.If there is no response to the initial injection, it is recommended to give a further adrenaline dose after five minutes. Adrenaline is effective very soon after being administered and wears off quite quickly.Patient positioningA person in anaphylactic shock should be placed in a comfortable position. Depending on the symptoms experienced, different positions will be advised:A person who feels faint, due to low blood pressure, should lie flat with their legs raised. Sitting or standing may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden loss of blood flow resulting from the failure of the heart to pump effectively
A person with airway and breathing problems may prefer to sit up, as this makes breathing easier
An unconscious person who is still breathing should be placed on their side in the recovery position[11]
A pregnant person should lie on their left side to avoid caval compression,i.e. compression of a large vein that leads to low blood pressureRemoving the triggerRemoving the trigger for anaphylaxis is not always possible, but may involve, for example:Removing the stinger from a bee sting. Early removal is more important than removal method
Rinsing mouth to remove traces of a food allergen. Attempts to make a person vomit after food-induced anaphylaxis are not recommended.Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)If the person is unresponsive and not breathing, CPR should be performed until the emergency services arrive.If untrained, a person can still use hands-only CPR. This is unlikely to make a person’s heart start beating again if it has stopped. However, it will pump some blood around the body, supplying organs and, most importantly, the brain with oxygen.Hospital treatmentPeople with presumed anaphylaxis are treated in the emergency department. The specifics of treatment depend on how well or unwell the person experiencing an anaphylactic reaction is.Treatment may include:[4][12]Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, usually injected into the thigh muscle.
Intravenous fluids to raise the blood pressure
Oxygen and inhalant medications
Steroids and antihistaminesIn severe cases, a breathing tube may be necessary until the immune reaction settles.","If a person has had one anaphylactic reaction, they are very likely to have another if exposed to the same allergen again. Subsequent episodes of anaphylaxis are often worse than the first one.There are several ways to manage the possibility of having another anaphylactic reaction:[13]Avoiding known triggersIt is important to take steps to avoid exposure to triggers. A person who has experienced anaphylaxis will be referred to a specialist allergy clinic to identify allergy triggers and for assessment and advice about how to avoid them in the future.Some people who have had an anaphylactic episode in response to common substances or medication choose to wear a piece of jewelry, often a bracelet which has their allergy engraved on it, to direct medical staff in the case of emergencies.[4]Being prepared for future emergenciesAn epinephrine autoinjector should be carried at all times. They contain a prescribed single dose of anaphylaxis medication that is injected into the thigh during an anaphylactic emergency. A doctor will explain to the person affected how to use this. It is also important that other people in close contact, such as family members, also know how to use the autoinjector.People at high risk of severe reactions should also have an anaphylaxis action plan for their school or workplace, which includes education on the prevention of exposure and how to act in case of anaphylaxis.Emergency anaphylaxis kits can also be prescribed in some cases. It is recommended that this include:[14]An adrenaline injection, also known as an epinephrine pen, which is the most important. This works rapidly to reverse all signs of anaphylaxis, most importantly low blood pressure, poor heart rate, poor circulation, swelling and asthma
H1 Antihistamine, which is particularly effective for skin symptoms and swelling, as a supporting medication to epinephrine
H2 Antihistamine, which is particularly effective when there are cardiovascular symptoms, as a supporting medication. This will also reduce abdominal discomfort.Allergen immunotherapyFor some people, it is possible to undergo allergen immunotherapy, also known as desensitization or hyposensitization therapy, which means the body is slowly exposed to the trigger responsible for their anaphylaxis. This causes the immune system to get used to the trigger gradually, helping to reduce the severity of the allergic reaction in the future.[15]","Q: Anaphylaxis vs anaphylactoid reaction –  what is the difference?
A: Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition triggered by a wide range of allergens and involving multiple organ systems. It occurs after exposure to a foreign protein, known as an antigen, that stimulates the production of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. These travel to cells and, after subsequent exposure to the antigen, stimulate the release of the chemicals that cause an allergic reaction. Anaphylactoid reactions appear to be exactly the same as anaphylactic reactions, but they do not involve previous exposure to the antigen. Anaphylactoid reactions are most commonly seen in reactions to contrast media used to increase the contrast of structures or fluids within the body for medical imaging.[16]Q: Allergic reaction vs anaphylaxis – what is the difference?
A: An allergy is an immune response to something that the body mistakenly perceives as a threat, such as pollen or animal dander. In most cases, people with allergies develop mild to moderate symptoms, which develop locally in the skin or eyes, for example. Sometimes, exposure to a triggering allergen can cause anaphylaxis. This happens when a person’s immune system over-releases chemicals, so that the reaction involves the respiratory and/or cardiovascular system, which can be life threatening."
Anemia,https://ada.com/conditions/anemia/,,"Common symptoms of anemia, regardless of the cause, include:[8]Fatigue (tiredness)
Lethargy (lack of energy)
Breathlessness
Faintness
HeadachesLess common symptoms of anemia may include:[1][17]Paleness
Palpitations (the feeling that the heart is skipping a beat or pounding)
Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
Muscle cramps
Loss of appetite
Altered sense of tasteThere may also be other symptoms, depending on the type of anemia. For example, iron deficiency anemia may cause wounds to heal slowly and brittle nails. VItamin B12 deficiency anemia may cause pins and needles, confusion and depression.In the early stages of anemia, some people may not experience symptoms.[18]","There are many possible causes of anemia. These include:[9][19]Dietary deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin B12, folic acid and iron
Malabsorption of nutrients, e.g. in celiac disease, Crohn’s disease
Substantial blood loss, e.g. from heavy menstruation or inflammatory bowel disease
Bone marrow problems and leukemia
Certain chronic conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease (anemia of chronic disease)
Certain genetic disorders, e.g. thalassemia and sickle cell disease
Certain infections, e.g. malaria
Certain medications and therapies, e.g. some types of painkillers, antibiotics, drugs for hyperthyroidism[17] and cancer treatments[18]
Periods where the body needs more energy than usual, such as puberty and pregnancy","As the first step, a doctor will typically take the person’s medical history and perform a physical examination. They may then order blood tests to check:[19][18]Hemoglobin levels and red blood cell size (complete blood count)
vitamin B12 and folate levels
Kidney functionThe doctor may also ask for the following tests to be done:[19][18]Urine tests
Stool (feces) tests
A bone marrow biopsy, removing a small sample for examination
A gastroscopy or colonoscopy to examine the digestive tractAs effective treatment of anemia depends on identifying the cause, the doctor will attempt to establish what this is. Further tests may be required if the cause is not clear.","The treatment recommended will depend on the underlying cause, as well as the severity of the anemia. Treatment may include:[19][18]Dietary changes to include more iron or vitamin-rich foods
Vitamin or iron supplements
Antibiotics, in the case of certain infections
Hormonal medication, in some cases of heavy menstruation[20]
Adjusting any medications or therapies that may be causing anemiaIn severe or persistent cases of anemia, the following may be recommended:[19][18][21]Medication to stimulate the production of red blood cells or to slow down their destruction
Medication to suppress the immune system, where this is involved[17]
Blood transfusions
Bone marrow transplants
Surgery to stop internal bleeding
Surgery to remove the spleen, where it is rapidly destroying red blood cells","While it may not be possible to prevent all types of anemia, steps can be taken to reduce the risk of developing anemia related to nutritional deficiencies. These include:[19][21]Eating a well-balanced diet
Eating fortified foods and/or taking vitamin and mineral supplements where one’s diet is restrictive, e.g. vegetarians and vegans
Avoiding regular consumption of tannin-containing tea or coffee with meatless meals, as this may interfere with absorption of iron from plant sources[24]","Q: Is anemia during pregnancy common?
A: Yes. Mild anemia is quite common during pregnancy, as a pregnant person needs more iron than usual.[19] It is recommended that a pregnant person eat foods that are rich in iron, such as dark green leafy vegetables, fortified cereals, eggs, nuts and lean meats to help prevent iron deficiency anemia. A doctor may also recommend a vitamin and mineral supplement. They may order blood tests to check the person’s iron levels during pregnancy. If any symptoms of anemia are present, a pregnant person should consult a doctor without delay.[25]For more information about achieving a balanced diet during pregnancy, see these resources on foods to eat during pregnancy and foods to avoid during pregnancy.Q: What are the best foods for anemia?
A: It depends on the type of anemia and what is causing it. In the case of iron deficiency anemia, iron-rich foods such as dark green leafy vegetables, fortified cereals, eggs, nuts and lean meats may be recommended to help treat the condition.[19] In the case of anemia caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid, other types of food may be recommended. In many cases, a well-balanced diet should provide sufficient nutrients to prevent anemia. If anemia is suspected, it is important to consult a medical practitioner, as self-diagnosis may be inaccurate."
Aortic Dissection,https://ada.com/conditions/aortic-dissection/,,"The main symptom of aortic dissection is a sudden, intense pain in the chest and upper back, commonly described as a shearing or ripping sensation. This pain may spread to the back, arms or legs, depending on the location of the dissection.Other symptoms may include:Shortness of breath
Cold hands or feet
Nausea
Sweating
Dizziness
General weaknessPeople experiencing an aortic dissection may also lose consciousness, depending on the amount of blood that is lost from the blood vessel. Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those of other heart conditions, including heart attack and stroke.","An aortic dissection typically occurs in a weakened area of the aorta. According to the Stanford classification system, there are two types of the condition, each defined by which part of the aorta is affected:Type A: Tear occurs close to where the aorta exits the heart or in the upper aorta, known as the ascending aorta. May affect the upper aorta only or the upper aorta, as well as the lower aorta. Even if only a very small section of the upper aorta is affected and a large area of the lower aorta, this will still be classed as type A.
Type B: Tear occurs in the lower aorta, known as the descending aorta.The DeBakey classification system, on the other hand, identifies three types of aortic dissection:[2]Type I: Tear occurs in the ascending and descending aorta.
Type II: Tear occurs in the ascending aorta only.
Type III: Tear occurs in the descending aorta only.The type of aortic dissection being experienced may affect the treatment options available.Risk factorsAortic dissection is more common in men than in women, and people between the ages of 50 and 65 are most at risk.Other risk factors include:High blood pressure
Smoking
High cholesterol levelsPeople who already have a weakened or enlarged aorta – an aortic aneurysm – or who have experienced angina, a heart attack or stroke are also at an increased risk of aortic dissection. Less common causes are cocaine use and chest injuries, such as those experienced as a result of a car accident.Certain genetic conditions are also known to increase the risk of aortic dissection; these include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Turner's syndrome.","The diagnosis is made by a doctor based on the symptoms and appearance of the affected person. In an emergency situation, an ultrasound scan may be carried out immediately to confirm the diagnosis.Other tests that may help to confirm the diagnosis include:Electrocardiogram (ECG)
X-rays of the chest and abdomen
CT scan (computed tomography)
MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging scan)","A type A, or type I and type II, aortic dissection is a medical emergency requiring surgery to repair the damaged aorta before complications can occur. Typically, a valve-sparing aortic root replacement, also known as a David procedure, will be performed.[3] This procedure preserves the aortic valve, grafting it to a new section of aortic tissue. In cases where the aortic valve is destroyed completely, it will typically be replaced with an artificial valve. This is major surgery carrying the risk of complications.A type B, or type III, aortic dissection may not necessarily require surgery. Medication, such as beta blockers - these may be used to manage blood pressure - or a less invasive type of surgery, elective endovascular repair, may be performed to redirect blood flow away from the dissection.[4]After initial treatment for both types of aortic dissection has been carried out, long-term use of blood pressure-lowering medication will typically be required. Many people will take this medication for the rest of their lives. Hospital visits, which may include CT and MRI scans, to check-up on the condition may also be necessary.[1]","Preventing an aortic dissection typically involves keeping blood pressure within a healthy range. To do this, a variety of lifestyle changes are recommended:Eating a healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals, fruits and vegetables, and low in sugar, fat and carbohydrates
Exercising regularly
Maintaining a healthy weight
Quitting smoking or not starting in the first place
Avoiding drugs, such as cocaine, and other stimulantsPreventive measures are particularly recommended for people within the at-risk groups for an aortic dissection. In combination with lifestyle changes, people with a history of high blood pressure should also take care to take their prescribed medication.",[]
Aphthous Mouth Ulcers,https://ada.com/conditions/aphthous-ulcers/,,"Aside from the ulcers (aphthae) themselves, the condition has very few symptoms. Before ulceration occurs, some individuals may begin to feel a burning or itching sensation inside the mouth which can be painful.The ulcers (aphthae) are normally shallow and begin as pale yellow in colour, generally turning grey as the condition develops. They may be ringed with red or appear fully red when inflamed. Depending on where the ulcers are located, eating, drinking and talking may become uncomfortable. In severe cases, aphthous ulcers can result in fever, swelling of the lymph nodes and physical lethargy.[4] These cases, however, are extremely rare.People experiencing possible symptoms of aphtous ulcers can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.","The precise cause or causes of aphthous ulcers (aphthae) are unknown, however, it is thought that ulceration is brought about by one or a combination of external triggers. It may also be partly genetic, with 40 percent of people who experience ulcers having a family history of the condition.Possible triggers of aphthous ulcers include:[5]Stress
Minor injury to the inside of the mouth (from dental work or brushing, for example)
Familial tendency
Sodium lauryl sulfate – an active ingredient in some toothpastes and mouthwashes (not proven as a trigger, but is known to prolong the time needed for ulcers to heal)
Certain food and drinks, including coffee, chocolate, eggs and cheese, as well as acidic or spicy foods
A deficiency of certain vitamins including zinc, B-12, folate and iron
An allergic reaction to oral bacteria
Quitting smokingSome medications are also linked to the development of ulcers, however, they may not always cause the aphthous variety of ulcers. They include:[6]Nicorandil
Ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory medicines
Medicines such as aspirin if left to dissolve in the mouth instead of being swallowed
Illegal drugs such as cocaineVery rarely, recurrent ulceration can be a possible indicator of several serious diseases, including:Crohn's disease
Celiac disease
Behcet’s disease
HIV/AIDSThe ulcers that are symptomatic of these disorders, however, may not be aphthous but closely resemble aphthous ulcers.[7] People who experience recurrent outbreaks of ulcers or ulcers that are slow to heal should see a doctor as soon as possible.","In most cases, especially when the condition is not recurrent, diagnosis will be based around medical examination and an investigation of an individual’s medical history.Diagnosis of recurrent ulceration is important due to its links to other, more serious conditions such as HIV, AIDS and celiac disease. The diagnostic process may involve the ruling out of these conditions through tissue, blood and viral testing, among other methods.[8] The course the diagnosis will take will depend on the doctor’s evaluation of the severity of an individual’s condition and the presence of any other symptoms.People experiencing possible symptoms of aphtous ulcers can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.","There is no cure for aphthous ulcers (aphthae), but there are ways to manage the symptoms. In the majority of cases, the ulcers will disappear without treatment and avoiding hard foods, numbing ointments and the application of cold substances to the affected area will be enough to manage the pain.When treatment is required, there are several possible options, with the chosen route depending on a doctor’s judgement of the probable efficacy of each.[9]Antibiotic treatmentTopical or systemic antibiotics, commonly tetracycline or minocycline, can be effective in treating ulcers. They are typically administered in mouthwash form, with the antibiotic being dissolved in water, swilled around the mouth and spat out. This may be necessary several times per day for a number of days.Anti-inflammatory treatmentAnti-inflammatory pastes applied directly to the problem area may be effective in managing the symptoms of aphthous ulcers (aphthae), particularly of the minor variety. These pastes should be applied between two and four times per day.Other treatmentsOther treatments include oral steroids, typically used when the ulcers are unresponsive to other treatment methods; silver nitrate; debacterol; local anaesthetics; and nutritional supplements (containing folate, zinc or B-12, for example).[10]","To lessen the likelihood of an ulcer outbreak, especially for those with a history of recurrent aphthous ulcers (aphthae), a number of measures can be taken.Avoiding foods that may trigger ulceration
Maintaining good dental hygiene and using a soft toothbrush to avoid irritation
Reducing stress and getting plenty of sleep","Q: Are there any home remedies for aphthous ulcers (aphthae)?
A: There are a number of popular home remedies for aphthous ulcers, including:[11]Rinsing the mouth with salt water
Application of milk of magnesia
Application of ice chips or cubes
Teething ointments containing local anaesthetic
Reducing stress
Avoiding hard foods or foods that may scratch the interior of the mouthQ: Can I get aphthous ulcers (aphthae) in the genital region?
A: Yes, although oral aphthous ulcers are most common, they may also appear in the genital region. This is most common in women, with the ulcers normally forming on the vulva or adjacent skin. The ulcers are in most cases of similar appearance to the oral version and may be similarly painful.[12]Q: What is recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS)?
A: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the name given to the condition of experiencing frequent outbreaks of aphthous mouth ulcers (aphthae). Although a single bout of aphthous stomatitis is possible, recurrent outbreaks are the norm.[13] Outbreaks of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) typically occur at intervals of between a few months to a few days and last for between 7 and 10 days at a time.Q: What is the relationship between aphthous ulcers (aphthae) and Behçet syndrome?
A: Behçet syndrome is characterized by inflammation in various areas of the body. One of Behçet syndrome’s distinguishing symptoms is the presence of aphthous ulceration in the oral cavity (mouth), as well as ulceration on others parts of the body, including the genitals. Although aphthous ulcers are a symptom of Behçet syndrome, not all individuals experiencing ulceration are affected by Behçet syndrome.[14]Q: What is complex aphthosis?
A: Complex aphthosis is the given name to the condition of having almost constant oral aphthae or recurrent oral and genital aphthae without having Behçet syndrome. When complex aphthosis is suspected, medical attention should be sought for diagnosis and treatment.[15]"
Appendix Pain,https://ada.com/conditions/appendix-pain/,,[],"As pain specific to acute appendicitis and abdominal pain from other causes are easily confused, it’s important to be aware of all of the common conditions that can cause this pain.Appendix pain location - which regions of the abdomen can be affected?Appendix pain is located in the abdomen.The abdomen can be divided into four quadrants, by imagining a vertical line running through the navel (belly button) and another running line through it horizontally.[5] The human abdomen is a large region of the human body, and it is the location of a number of organs and organ systems.[6]The left upper quadrant contains the stomach, spleen, left kidney, small intestine, descending colon and transverse colon.[7]The left lower quadrant contains the small intestine and the descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum.[6]The lower right quadrant contains the small intestine, the cecum and the appendix, as well as the ascending colon.The upper right quadrant contains the pancreas, gallbladder, liver, right kidney, small intestine, ascending colon and transverse colon.The bladder lies roughly on the midline of the lower quadrants. The abdominal cavity is lined by the peritoneum, which is made up of connective tissue.[6] The peritoneum can become infected, a condition known as peritonitis (see below). The organs are held in a web of tissue known as the mesentery.In men, the abdomen also contains the prostate, which is situated just below the bladder. In women, the abdomen also contains the uterus, cervix, ovaries and fallopian tubes. These differences between men and women mean that, in some cases, pain may be felt differently. This is partly because different organs and structures are involved. In acute appendicitis, men and women experience pain in the same regions.Different disorders within the abdominal region may cause pain in different regions. For example, gastritis is usually felt in the left upper abdominal quadrant, while pain from an inflamed gallbladder or gallstones is felt in the right upper region. Pain which is experienced in the region of the appendix may be from acute appendicitis, but it may also result from other disorders and diseases of organs in the abdominal region.Good to know: Pain from kidney problems is usually described as being in the back or side, rather than as pain in the abdomen.Acute appendicitisAcute appendicitis is a common condition that can affect people of all ages. It is an inflammation of the appendix, thought to be caused by a blockage of the appendix or by the appendix becoming infected. The main symptom of acute appendicitis is severe pain in the abdomen. This will usually begin as a dull pain located around the stomach area or belly-button region, before gradually moving to the lower right side and becoming sharper and more severe. At this stage, the portion of the abdomen where the appendix is located may be painful or tender to touch.Other symptoms of acute appendicitis may include:[8]Nausea
Vomiting
Fever
Constipation
Frequent urination, because of irritation of and around the ureter, which can imitate the symptoms of a urinary tract infectionIf the condition is left untreated, the appendix can burst. If this happens, an individual will typically experience severe pain across the entire abdominal region. This can cause peritonitis, a medically significant condition (see below).If any symptoms of the condition occur and acute appendicitis is suspected, immediate medical attention should be sought. A person will be admitted to hospital and usually undergo surgery to remove the appendix. This common procedure is called an appendectomy and is considered routine by doctors. It will usually be carried out using laparoscopic surgery.Other causes of abdominal painAlthough acute appendicitis is a common cause of severe pain in the region of the appendix, there are a variety of other possible causes. The source of pain in this location is often difficult to pinpoint, meaning that pain, which feels like the result of acute appendicitis, may in fact stem from a different source, such as a problem related to other parts of the intestines or the kidneys.Other possible causes of abdominal pain include:[9][10][11][12]Food poisoning
Diarrhea
Constipation
Vomiting
Stomach ulcers
Crohn’s disease
Irritable bowel syndrome
Inflammatory bowel disease
Diverticulitis
Infectious enterocolitis
Peritonitis
Gallstones
Inflamed gallbladder
Kidney infections
Kidney stones
Pancreatitis
Hepatitis
Urinary tract infectionsWomen may additionally experience abdominal pain, usually in the lower abdomen, as a result of:Pelvic inflammatory disease
Ovarian cysts, ovarian torsion or inflamed ovaries
Ectopic pregnancy
Endometriosis
Dysmenorrhea
MiscarriageIn rare cases, pain in the appendix area/abdomen can also be a symptom of a tumorous condition (benign or malignant). Nevertheless if a tumorous condition is suspected, urgent medical attention may be required. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[13]",[],[],[],"Q: In what location do you experience appendix pain?
A: In most cases of appendicitis, the pain will typically begin around the stomach or belly button area and move to the lower right side of the abdomen, while also becoming sharper and more severe.Q: Why is appendix pain sometimes felt on the left?
A: In most cases, pain from acute appendicitis is felt on the right. However, some people experience it on the left. This occurs when the inflammation affecting the appendix spreads to the peritoneum, the lining of the abdominal cavity.A common test that can distinguish possible appendicitis from other abdominal pain uses rebound tenderness to determine whether it is the appendix that is inflamed, or another structure. In this test, the doctor slowly presses their fingers on a part of the abdomen that does not hurt - in the case of suspected acute appendicitis, this would be the left-hand side - and then quickly lets go. The affected person feels pain in the lower right abdominal area. This sort of pain is known as “contralateral rebound tenderness”, as pain occurs on the side opposite to where the pressure is applied.In very few cases, the reason for appendix pain being felt on the left may be because of a hereditary condition known as situs inversus, in which the organs of the chest and abdomen are in mirror-image positions – that is, they are on the opposite side to where they are in most people.[24] In people with situs inversus, for example, the liver and appendix are on the left of the abdomen. However, situs inversus only affects about one in 8000 people, and it is far more likely that, if you feel appendix pain on the left, it is because of rebound tenderness.[25]"
Arthritis,https://ada.com/conditions/arthritis/,,[],[],"In order to receive appropriate treatment, it is important to fully describe the nature of joint pain to the doctor, making sure to include information such as:How long you have been experiencing joint inflammation and pain
The location and severity of the pain
If any family members have experienced arthritis or autoimmune conditions
Whether there are other symptoms that occur besides the joint inflammation and painFollowing the investigation of a person’s medical history, a doctor will typically perform a physical exam to check for swollen joints or loss of motion, and use blood tests and X-rays to confirm a diagnosis and distinguish the type of arthritis.[16]","It is always important to seek prompt diagnosis and treatment of arthritis, as well as any other associated conditions, in order to prevent joint damage, which can lead to physical disability. Arthritis treatment will vary, depending on the type of arthritis, but generally may include:Rest
Exercise
Medication
Occupational or physical therapy
In some cases, surgery",[],"Q: How many types of arthritis exist?
A: Some sources estimate that there are over 200 different types of arthritis and related diseases. Arthritis can range from mild to severe. Causes are normally either degenerative “wear-and-tear” of cartilage, such as with osteoarthritis, or inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Together all of these forms of arthritis make up the most chronic illness in the U.S. It is important to find out which type of arthritis is present, as each condition will have a different underlying cause, progression and treatment.Q: Are there home remedies for arthritis?
A: Yes, there are a number of home remedies for arthritis, which may help to relieve symptoms, but will not have a significant impact on the progress of the disease. Some of the most regularly cited include:Using heat pads or ice packs
Swimming
Omega-3, which is found in fish, canola oil and supplementsHowever, if arthritis is suspected, professional medical attention should always be sought.Q: What are some risk factors for arthritis?
A: Although it depends on the type of arthritis, some factors increase the risks of several different types. Arthritis risk factors include:[17][18]Smoking tobacco
Being overweight
Certain inherited traits, such as HLA-B27, a gene associated with autoimmune conditions
Increasing age
Joint injury or certain repetitive movements"
Asthma,https://ada.com/conditions/asthma/,,"An asthma attack occurs when tiny muscles around the airways tighten, the airway lining becomes inflamed, and mucus builds up, causing even more airway restriction. Typical symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness.People experiencing possible symptoms of asthma can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",[],"Diagnosis is usually made by assessing symptom patterns and with a measurement of airflow through the lungs, called spirometry.","Asthma treatment consists of various medications with targeted effects. These might be taken as needed or, if a person suffers symptoms regularly, they might need to be taken every day. For example, inhaled corticosteroids aim to reduce the inflammation that leads to airway swelling and narrowing. Another medication called beta-agonists relax the small muscles that narrow airways during an asthma attack. Overall, the medications aim to open the airways, improve airflow, and make breathing easier.",Prevention may be achieved by avoiding known allergens.,[]
Atherosclerosis,https://ada.com/conditions/atherosclerosis/,,[],"Atherosclerosis is caused by a buildup of plaque in the artery walls. Plaque is composed of calcium, cholesterol, fats and other substances found in the blood. If it hardens, plaque can block the arteries and restrict blood flow.[3]A number of pre-existing conditions, lifestyle choices and other factors can make atherosclerosis more likely. The most common of these include:[4]High cholesterol levels
High blood pressure
Diabetes
Smoking
Obesity
Lack of physical activity
Unhealthy diet (high in salt, sugar, fats and cholesterol)
Ageing
Family history of cardiovascular disease
Stress
Alcohol consumption","Diagnosing atherosclerosis will generally involve a doctor looking at an individual’s medical history, a physical examination and a range of tests.During the physical examination, a stethoscope will normally be used to listen to the individual’s heartbeat and blood flow in the vessels. The medical professional will take special care to listen for sounds that indicate the narrowing of the blood vessels, which can often indicate the presence of plaque and clogged arteries.Tests that may aid a diagnosis of atherosclerosis include:[12]Blood pressure measurement: A doctor will check whether the readings are out of range.
Blood tests: To check the levels of fats, sugars, cholesterol and protein in the blood.
Electrocardiogram (EKG): A method for testing the electrical activity of the heart.
Chest X-ray: An image of the organs and blood vessels within the chest is taken, allowing doctors to check for abnormalities.
Echocardiography: An ultrasound is used to create an image of the heart. This can give doctors a holistic picture of the heart’s health.
Computed tomography (CT) scan: A computer-generated image of the body is created, allowing doctors to see signs of artery narrowing or hardening.
Angiography: A contrast dye is injected into specific blood vessels, which can then be visualized by X-ray. Catheters are often used. This test allows doctors to see signs of atherosclerosis.","At present, no treatment exists to reverse atherosclerosis. However, there are a variety of ways to slow the progress of the condition and reduce the risk of complications, such as heart attack and stroke.[13] These include:[14]Lifestyle changes that are also used to help prevent atherosclerosis (see below)
Statins and other medications used to treat high cholesterol
Medications used to treat high blood pressure
Low-dose aspirin and other medications used to treat blood clots
Medications for diabetes
Surgical procedures to bypass or widen an artery, such as a coronary artery bypass graft or coronary angioplastyA doctor will be able to advise on the treatment options available in each case. Doctors can also recommend lifestyle changes that may help manage the condition.","As there is no direct treatment for atherosclerosis, health care professionals place emphasis on methods of preventing the condition from developing. These preventive methods include:Stopping smoking
Getting regular exercise
Eating a healthy, balanced diet
Maintaining a healthy weight
Avoiding alcoholA doctor will be able to advise on the best methods of pursuing these lifestyle changes.","Q: Is atherosclerosis of the aorta possible?
A: Yes, plaque deposits can form in the aorta, causing atherosclerosis. Aortic atherosclerosis can cause an aortic aneurysm and increase the risk of stroke.[15]Q: What is atherosclerotic calcification?
A: The plaque that builds up as a result of atherosclerosis generally contains traces of calcium. Atherosclerotic calcification refers to the process of calcium buildup, which is of particular interest to doctors and scientists due to its similarity to the process of bone formation.[16]Q: What is the difference between atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis?
A: Atherosclerosis is a specific variety of arteriosclerosis, though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Arteriosclerosis refers to a hardening and loss of elasticity in the arteries, which can be caused by atherosclerosis or other conditions."
Atopic Dermatitis,https://ada.com/conditions/atopic-dermatitis/,,"The symptoms of atopic dermatitis will usually appear before the age of 5. Typical symptoms of the condition include:[1]Itchiness of the skin, which may intensify at nighttime
Patches of red, inflamed skin
Small bumps on the skin
Skin flakingAtopic dermatitis is usually confined to one area of the body, though it can affect multiple areas in severe cases. Areas of skin which are near skin creases – such as the elbows, wrists, back of the knees and neck – are the most commonly affected areas. In infants, the face is the most commonly affected area.Thickened skin or scars can develop from scratching or rubbing. If the affected area becomes infected, thick, yellow pus, as well as redness and crusting may appear.The symptoms experienced, as well as the severity and duration of a flare-up, will differ from person to person.","The causes of atopic dermatitis are not yet fully understood. What is known is that the lipid (oily) barrier of skin is diminished in people with the condition and that substances, or cytokines, released by cells in the immune system may be a factor. The reason why these things affect some people and not others is unknown, however.[2]There is a genetic element to atopic dermatitis. If both parents have the condition, a child stands roughly an 80 percent chance of inheriting it themselves; if only one parent has the condition, this figure drops to 60 percent.[2]Risk factorsAtopic dermatitis is a common condition, especially in children younger than 5 years old. It is uncommon to experience a first episode in adulthood.People with atopy – a predisposal to allergic conditions such as hay fever and allergic asthma, for example, tend to have a slightly higher chance of developing atopic dermatitis. Other factors that are known to trigger the condition include:Skin dryness
Heat
Perspiration
Irritating substances, such as certain clothing or chemicals
Emotional or physical stress
Skin infections",A doctor or dermatologist will usually diagnose atopic dermatitis based on the symptoms and an examination of the affected skin. Skin or blood tests are not usually necessary to reach a diagnosis.[3],"There is no cure for atopic dermatitis, meaning treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms. In many cases, symptoms will naturally improve with age.The two main treatment methods for atopic dermatitis are:[1][2][4]Emollients, or moisturizers
Steroid creams and ointments (topical steroids)Treatment for atopic dermatitis aims to reduce the number and severity of flare-ups by reducing skin irritation and promoting skin health.EmollientsEmollients are lotions, creams, ointments and bathing additives that help to prevent the skin from becoming dry, one of the key characteristics of atopic dermatitis. Keeping the skin moist helps to protect the skin from various irritants, which reduces the number of flare-ups experienced.Depending on the severity of the condition, emollients may need to be applied between two and several times per day. They are most effective when applied directly after bathing – within three minutes – and should be applied liberally.[5] The most effective emollients are generally thick and contain little water, though a doctor, dermatologist or pharmacist will be able to advise on the best variety for each person.Good to know: It is advisable to manage atopic dermatitis using products which have been specifically recommended for the use of people with the condition. Many commercial skincare products contain perfumes, and/or other chemicals which could irritate sensitive skin.Steroid creams and ointmentsSteroid creams and ointments, otherwise known as topical steroids, are used to reduce skin inflammation. They come in various strengths, from mild to very potent, with the stronger varieties being more effective at treating inflammation but with a greater risk of side-effects. Possible side-effects include a mild stinging when applied, and, more rarely, thinning of the skin, skin discoloration, acne and increased hair growth.[4]For this reason, the long-term regular use of topical steroids is not recommended, and a course of this type of medication will typically need to be used for between 7 and 14 days. Commonly, a mild steroid will first be prescribed, followed by a stronger variety if the flare-up does not clear up within three to seven days. The cream or ointment will usually need to be applied liberally once or twice per day. In very severe cases, a short-course of steroid tablets may be prescribed to help manage symptoms when topical steroids have proven ineffective.Other treatment methodsAdditional treatment methods for atopic dermatitis include:[1][4]Antihistamine tablets; sometimes used to help manage the itching associated with atopic dermatitis. They can be very effective but tend to cause drowsiness in some people.
Ultraviolet light therapy; generally only recommended for people who have not responded to other treatment methods due to the expense as well as the possible risk of skin cancer.
Immunosuppressive drugs; sometimes used in severe cases when no other treatment methods have proven effective. Can cause serious side-effects, including an increased risk of infection.
Wet dressings can be used to hydrate and soothe the skin during a flare-up.","Identifying and avoiding triggers that may cause symptoms to worsen can help in preventing episodes of atopic dermatitis.Triggers to avoid may include:Hot, dry environments
Perspiration
Certain chemicals and solutions, such as detergents, perfumes and cosmetics
Wool or synthetic clothingOnce triggers have been identified, a person’s doctor or dermatologist will be able to help with devising methods of avoiding them.Other methods of preventing atopic dermatitis from worsening include blotting the skin dry instead of rubbing after bathing as well as ensuring the fingernails of children are kept short to prevent wounds from scratching.","Q: Do I need to see a specialist?
A: In most cases, a general practitioner will be capable of diagnosing and treating atopic dermatitis. However, if the usual treatment methods prove ineffective, it is not clear what is causing the condition and/or the dermatitis is particularly severe, the affected person may be recommended to a dermatologist, a specialist skin doctor. A dermatologist will be able to give additional support, including helping to identify any triggers and devising alternative treatment methods.[4]Q: Are there any home treatment methods for atopic dermatitis?
A: There are several ways in which to treat the symptoms of atopic dermatitis at home. These include using wet dressings – a piece of clothing or bandage soaked in water – to help keep the skin moist, bathing regularly – no more than once daily unless otherwise advised – and the use of over-the-counter emollients."
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://ada.com/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/,,"The symptoms of ADHD may first be recognised by a parent, teacher or caregiver. They can in some cases be difficult to distinguish from age-appropriate energeticness and/or misbehavior.The core symptoms are persistent hyperactivity, inattention and/or impulsivity. These behaviors should be displayed in more than one setting – for example, at home and at school – and during more than one activity – for example, when doing schoolwork and when going to bed.To be classed as ADHD, the symptoms must:[1]First appear before the age of 12
Occur in more than one setting
Occur for at least six months
Interfere with social, academic and/or occupational activities
Be unrelated to any other condition or disorder that the child may haveThe symptoms of ADHD tend to vary from child to child. There are, however, three key subtypes that most cases will fit into.[1][2]Hyperactive-impulsive subtype: Hyperactivity and impulsivity commonly occur together in young children with ADHD. This may mean that a child feels the need to move around constantly, talk a lot and may struggle with controlling their impulses.
Inattention subtype: The main features of this subtype are difficulty paying attention and reduced cognitive ability. This may mean that a child is easily distracted, struggles to take in and follow instructions, and is forgetful. The symptoms of inattention will typically not become apparent until a child is eight or nine years old.[3]
Combined subtype: Children with this subtype will display features of both the hyperactive and inattention subtypes.Hyperactivity in children with ADHD tends to fade after the age of eight or nine and may be difficult to detect to outside observers from then on. The adolescent, however, may still experience restlessness or find it difficult to settle down. Symptoms of impulsivity and inattention tend to persist throughout a person's life, although inattention may not be detectable until the age of eight or nine.","The exact cause of ADHD is not fully understood by medical professionals, though a number of factors are believed to play a role.Factors that are thought to contribute to ADHD include:[1][3][4][5]Brain function and structure: Research suggests that there are small differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared with the brains of people without the condition. The significance of this is not yet clear.
Genetics: Research suggests that a child is more likely to develop ADHD if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, also has the condition.
Learning issues: While learning issues do not cause ADHD, children with conditions such as dyslexia, dyscalculia and dysgraphia are more likely to also experience ADHD.
Antenatal problems: If a mother smokes, drinks alcohol or takes drugs during pregnancy, this may increase the likelihood of the child having ADHD.
Birth problems: If a child is born with a low birth weight, is deprived of oxygen during birth or experiences any other kind of issue during birth, this may increase their chance of developing ADHD.One or more of these factors may apply to a child with ADHD. Conversely, none of these factors may apply and there may be no clear cause of the condition.","The diagnosis is usually made by a specialist pediatric doctor with experience in child development. There is no special test for ADHD; instead, a diagnosis will be based on the symptoms displayed and through an observation of the child’s interactions with their parents, siblings and, if possible, teachers and classmates.Seeking a formal diagnosis is important because it enables families and teachers to coordinate plans for managing behavior and education.","The way in which a child with ADHD is treated will depend on the severity of the condition as well as the age of the child. Treatment should be coordinated by a team of professionals, including pediatricians, ADHD specialists and behavioral therapists.The condition cannot be cured, but it can be effectively managed. The first stage of treatment will usually involve referral to a parent-training programme. The aim of this kind of training is to teach parents ways to manage behavioral problems, to understand the condition more thoroughly and to communicate more effectively with their child. These methods may also need to be taught to teachers and other caregivers, so activities can be tailored to suit the child’s attention span.[1]Other treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a method of psychological training that can help a child to understand why they act as they do and to come up with strategies to help manage their condition.All children, including those with ADHD, are recommended to get at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity activity per day. Regular physical activity is associated with improved cardiovascular health, mental wellbeing and cognitive performance.Medication can also be prescribed to help treat ADHD in children over the age of six. Methylphenidate is the most commonly prescribed medication. It works by increasing the amount of dopamine released into the parts of the brain responsible for attention and self-control. A child may need to take medication for a number of years.[1]Medication is generally prescribed in severe cases of ADHD or in milder cases when other treatment options have not been effective. When used in children, ADHD medications are not thought to have an addictive potential. They can, however, cause side-effects.Possible side-effects of methylphenidate include:[6]A slight increase in blood pressure and heart rate
Loss of appetite
Sleeping problems
Headaches
Stomach aches
Mood swings",[],[]
Baby Eczema,https://ada.com/conditions/baby-eczema/,,"Eczema in babies appears as dry, red, scaly, itchy and flaky skin. In young babies, the scalp,
face, ears and neck are the most commonly affected areas. In older babies, the arms and legs
may be more commonly affected, especially around the elbows and knees, as well as the diaper
area. [2] In severe cases, baby eczema can cause painful cracking of the skin, with oozing
and bleeding. As children get older, the skin that is affected by the condition normally
becomes less red but scalier, leatherier and thicker – this is known as lichenification and
may also occur as a result of persistent scratching.[3]If your baby is experiencing possible symptoms of baby eczema, carry out a symptom assessment with the free Ada app now.",[],"Diagnosing eczema in babies is relatively easy due to the visibility and characteristic
appearance of the condition. A doctor will examine the baby and judge whether the symptoms
are a result of eczema (atopic dermatitis or contact dermatitis, which results from exposure
to allergens or irritants and can usually be treated quickly.","As soon as the presence of baby eczema becomes apparent, treatment options should be explored
quickly to avoid the condition spreading or becoming more severe. Understanding and avoiding
the potential causes and triggers of baby eczema is key to managing the condition, but a
variety of further options are also available.[6] In particularly severe cases, a consultation
with a specialist dermatologist may be necessary.Moisturizing ointments and creamsUsing a moisturizing ointment or cream to keep the skin soft and moist is key to tackling
baby eczema.[7] Moisturizers are classified according to their oil and water content, with
the most effective moisturizers containing a higher amount of oil.Ointments and barrier creams should be applied to the skin in a thick layer at least twice
per day and immediately after bathing. They can be bought over the counter at the pharmacy
or be prescribed by a doctor.Topical SteroidsMild topical steroids (steroids applied to the skin) can be used to reduce the redness and
soreness of baby eczema flare-ups.[8] These steroids are perfectly safe when applied correctly
and under the guidance of a healthcare professional. They are, however, generally intended
for short-term use, unless otherwise advised by a doctor.SoapsUnscented, additive-free and dye-free cleansers only should be used on babies experiencing
eczema. A range of such products are available and should be used in conjunction with
moisturizing ointments or topical steroids. It is generally advised that a doctor’s opinion
should be sought before using these products.BathingAn appropriate bathing routine is critical to treating baby eczema. Baths are recommended
over showers and should be warm rather than hot and last no longer than 10 minutes. They
should also be followed by the application of prescribed topical lotions and ointments.",[],"Q: Will my child grow out of eczema?
A: In most cases, yes. Eczema generally develops in children from the age of two
months-old and peters out by around three years-old. However, some children can experience
eczema into the teenage years and even into adulthood.[9]Q: Are there any home remedies that can be used to treat baby eczema?
A: There are a number of home remedies that can be used to treat some of the symptoms
of baby eczema. However, it is generally a good idea to seek a doctor’s opinion and follow
the treatment path outlined. Bathing in water mixed with oatmeal, using a humidifier and
the application of coconut oil are among the most common home remedies.[10]Q: What does the term “atopic” mean?
A: Atopic (as in atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis) refers to a predisposition toward developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions such as eczema, asthma or hay fever.[1] Atopic eczema in babies and atopic dermatitis in babies are simply synonyms of baby eczema.Q: What is dermatitis?
A: Dermatitis is an umbrella term for a group of conditions that cause inflammation of the skin. Although the different types of dermatitis have differing causes, most involve the onset of red, itchy and dry skin or a rash. Baby eczema, or atopic dermatitis, is one form of dermatitis. Others include contact dermatitis (caused by the skin coming into contact with irritants) and seborrheic dermatitis (which can cause a flare-up of red skin, scaly patches and dandruff).[11]Q: What is the relationship between food allergies and baby eczema?
A: Food allergies are common in infants with eczema. However, they are separate conditions and it is not accurate to say that food allergies cause eczema. Instead, it appears that having eczema may increase the chances of an infant developing allergies to certain foods. A flare-up of both conditions may cause a rash or red, itchy skin, however, eczema is typically focussed on specific parts of the body (hands, face, neck) while an allergic reaction is more unpredictable.[12]"
Bacterial Conjunctivitis,https://ada.com/conditions/bacterial-conjunctivitis/,,"Bacterial conjunctivitis often begins in one eye and then spreads to the other. Symptoms may include:[1][3][4][7]Pinkness or redness in the eye
Burning, itching, a sensation of grittiness, or mild pain or discomfort in the eye
Increased watering of the eye
Thick, sticky, often yellowish discharge from the eye; this can form a “crust” at night, making the eyes feel as if they are glued shut in the morning
Swollen eyelids
Slight sensitivity to bright light
Swelling of the lymph nodes in front of the earsBacterial conjunctivitis usually only causes mild symptoms and does not affect a person’s vision, other than causing slight blurriness when discharge has built up on and around the eye.[4][7] Depending on the type of bacteria causing the infection, there may be additional symptoms.If symptoms are severe or vision is impaired, it is important to contact a doctor without delay. It is also extremely important to see a doctor if any signs of bacterial conjunctivitis are present in a newborn baby.","The most common causes of bacterial conjunctivitis are the following types of bacteria:[7]Staphylococcus aureus
Staphylococcus epidermidis
Streptococcus pneumonia
Haemophilus influenzae; this is not the same as the flu, which is caused by a virusLess commonly, the infection can be the result of the following sexually transmitted infections (STIs):[4]Chlamydia
GonorrheaBacterial conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea is more serious and requires treatment by a doctor.","When symptoms are mild, a diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis can often be made without seeing a doctor, and the condition can be treated at home. However, if there is any uncertainty or concern over the condition, or the symptoms are severe, seeing a doctor is very important.A doctor will take the person’s medical history and ask whether anyone they know might have had an eye infection recently. They will examine the eyes and assess the signs and symptoms present, taking care to rule out acute viral conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis and other more serious eye conditions, such as uveitis.[3][5][7]In most cases, it will not be necessary to order laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis. However, in cases that are severe or do not respond to treatment, as well as in the case of infants, the doctor may take a small swab from the eyelid and test it to determine the cause of the infection and ensure that the treatment approach is correct.[8][9][5]","Mild cases of bacterial conjunctivitis often clear up within 1-2 weeks without special medical treatment.The following home remedies and over-the-counter treatments may help to relieve the discomfort caused by conjunctivitis:[1][9][4][6][7]Gently cleaning discharge from the eye with a clean cloth, sterile pad or cotton wool soaked in water
Applying lubricating eye drops, called artificial tears, which are available without a prescription, to the eye; care must be taken not to use the drops in the other eye, if only one eye is infected
Applying a cold or warm compress, a clean cloth that has been soaked in water, to the eye
Avoiding the use of contact lenses until the infection has clearedAntibiotics for bacterial conjunctivitisAntibiotic eye drops or eye ointment may help to clear up the infection more quickly. However, they are not always needed, and many cases of mild bacterial conjunctivitis will resolve on their own, without antibiotic treatment.[7]Topical antibiotics are typically recommended for more severe or persistent cases of bacterial conjunctivitis, with eye drops usually preferred over ointments for ease of use.[4][7]Less commonly, where the cause of bacterial conjunctivitis is chlamydia or gonorrhea, a course of oral or injected antibiotics may be necessary.[7]","While it may not always be possible to prevent bacterial conjunctivitis, taking the following steps can help to reduce the likelihood of an infection:[10][1]Avoiding contact with people who have pink eye
Maintaining good hygiene, such as washing your hands often with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer
Avoiding touching your eyes when your hands are not cleanIf you have bacterial conjunctivitis, the following actions can help avoid spreading the infection to others:[10][1][8]Maintaining good hygiene, such as washing your hands often with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer, especially after treating the eyes
Cleaning your spectacles
Avoiding touching the eyes other than when treating them, as this can spread the bacteria
Washing pillowcases and towels often and avoiding sharing them with others
Avoiding sharing makeup and eye drops
When necessary, staying off school or work until symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis have cleared; this is generally when the eyes are no longer red and irritated
Avoiding the use of swimming poolsIn addition, contact lenses should not be worn until symptoms have cleared, and a new pair used when the infection has gone away. Some makeup may also need to be discarded and replaced to prevent reinfection.[10][1]","Q: Viral vs. bacterial conjunctivitis – what is the difference?
A: While both types of conjunctivitis are highly contagious, the causes, some of the symptoms and the treatments are different. Viral conjunctivitis is caused by a virus, often from the group of viruses that cause the common cold, results in a watery discharge from the eye, and has no specific treatment. Bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by bacteria, often types of staphylococcus or streptococcus, is spread through poor hygiene or contact with other people or insects, results in a thick, sticky discharge from the eye, and may – in some cases – require antibiotic eye drops.[8][9][2][11]Q: My child has bacterial conjunctivitis. Is it necessary to keep them home from school?
A: It depends on the region and institution. Some experts feel that a child should not be required to stay at home with bacterial conjunctivitis, unless an outbreak of multiple cases has occurred. However, a particular daycare center or school may have their own policy and ask that a child with bacterial conjunctivitis be kept at home until their symptoms have cleared up, to reduce the likelihood of infecting other children.[4]"

Campylobacter
Shigella
Escherichia coli (E.coli)
Yersinia
Staphylococcus
Clostridium difficileIn some cases, the bacteria may be transmitted directly from one person to another, but they are typically spread through contaminated food and water. Sources of bacterial gastroenteritis include:[3][4][6]Unhygienic food preparation, e.g. a cook not washing their hands after going to the toilet, or using the same cutting boards for both meat and salads
Raw or undercooked meat, eggs and fish
Unpasteurized dairy and juices
Inadequately-treated drinking waterIt can also be spread through food that is not stored properly, e.g. poor refrigeration that leads to food spoiling, as well as from raw fruits and vegetables that are not thoroughly washed in clean water. Contact with reptiles, birds and amphibians can also be a route of transmission for Salmonella bacteria.Traveler’s diarrheaBacterial gastroenteritis is a common cause of traveler’s diarrhea, a condition which frequently affects overseas travelers, particularly in developing countries. It is often the result of inadequate food hygiene at local restaurants and food outlets.[7] For more information on traveler’s diarrhea, see the FAQ below.Bacterial gastroenteritis caused by exotoxinsSome cases of bacterial gastroenteritis are not caused by bacteria themselves, but instead by toxins that they release. The harmful byproducts of certain types of bacteria can contaminate food, causing food poisoning when ingested. These byproducts are called exotoxins, and they usually cause symptoms within 12 hours of consuming the contaminated food. This type of gastroenteritis typically clears up within 36 hours.[8]","When symptoms are mild, a diagnosis of bacterial gastroenteritis can often be made without seeing a doctor, and the condition can be treated at home.[1] However, if there is any uncertainty or concern over the condition, or symptoms are severe, seeing a doctor is very important.A doctor will take the person’s medical history and perform a physical examination, taking care to rule out other gastrointestinal conditions such as gastritis. In most cases, it will not be necessary to order tests to confirm the diagnosis of gastroenteritis. However, in cases that are severe or long lasting, a doctor may request blood and/or stool tests.[1][3][4]","Most cases of bacterial gastroenteritis clear up without specific medical treatment. As long as symptoms are not severe and there are no signs of dehydration, a person can generally treat bacterial gastroenteritis in an adult or child at home.Home remediesThe following home remedies and over-the-counter treatment approaches are recommended for mild cases of bacterial gastroenteritis:[1][9]Bed rest
Consuming plenty of fluids in the form of water or oral rehydration drinks; at the very least, small sips should be taken between being sick or having bowel movements
Eating light meals when the appetite returns; plain foods like bread and rice may be helpful
Taking an antidiarrheal medication, e.g. loperamide, only when necessary and there is no fever, and no blood or mucus is present in the stool
Taking antiemetic (anti-nausea) medication for nausea and vomiting, when necessary
Taking probiotics may slightly shorten the duration of diarrhea[8]If a person is unable to keep any fluids down or shows signs of dehydration (see below), they may need to be treated with an IV drip at a hospital.Antibiotics for bacterial gastroenteritisIn mild cases of bacterial gastroenteritis, antibiotics are typically not considered necessary and will not be prescribed. Antibiotic medication is generally only recommended in severe cases, or when a person has a weakened immune system.[3]","Good personal hygiene and food preparation hygiene, as well as safe food storage and the use of water only from clean, adequately-treated sources, can help to reduce the risk of developing bacterial gastroenteritis.The following general precautions are recommended:[1][5][9]Always wash your hands well with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, after using the toilet
Always wash your hands well before preparing food, and after handling any raw meat or fish
Wash fruit and vegetables in clean water before using them
Use different chopping boards for meat and vegetables, and clean them thoroughly with a disinfectant after use
Regularly clean kitchen work surfaces with a disinfectant
Cook all meat and fish well
Store food in clean containers at appropriate temperatures; throw out anything that seems to have spoiled
When traveling to other countries, drink only bottled water or water that has been boiled for at least 10 minutes; and only eat food that has been well cooked and fruit that can be peeled[9]If you have bacterial gastroenteritis, doing the following can help to prevent the spread of the infection:[1][2][5][9]Wash your hands well with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, after using the toilet
Clean the toilet and bathroom thoroughly with disinfectant on a daily basis
Avoid sharing cutlery, towels, clothing and linen; also wash your items separately in hot water, with bleach if possible
Avoid preparing food for other people for at least two days after the vomiting or diarrhea has cleared up
Stay off work or school, if possible, until at least two days after the vomiting or diarrhea has cleared up
Avoid swimming for two weeks after the vomiting or diarrhea has cleared up","Q: Is bacterial gastroenteritis contagious?
A: Yes, bacterial gastroenteritis is contagious, which means that it can be spread directly from person to person. However, it is most often spread via contaminated food and water. Practicing good hygiene, such as washing one’s hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after going to the toilet and before eating, can help to reduce the risk of developing bacterial gastroenteritis.[1][3]Q: How can I tell if it is bacterial gastroenteritis or viral gastroenteritis?
A: In most cases of gastroenteritis, it is not necessary to find out whether the cause is viral or bacterial, as the treatment is largely the same and is aimed at providing relief from symptoms. However, in some cases, if symptoms are severe or do not clear up, a doctor may recommend tests to identify the cause and prescribe a specific treatment, such as antibiotics.[2][3][12][13]Q: Should I be worried about “traveler’s diarrhea”?
A: Traveler’s diarrhea is a name given to episodes of gastroenteritis, most commonly bacterial gastroenteritis, which develop during or shortly after travel abroad.  The main symptom is diarrhea, which is typically watery, though nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain may also occur. Most cases of traveler's diarrhea are relatively mild and can be managed without the need for medical advice. Dehydration is the main risk, so it is important to consume plenty of fluids and get sufficient rest. Medical advice should be sought in any of the following situations:[10]A fever is present
There is blood in the stool
There is difficulty replacing fluids because of frequent bouts of diarrhea or vomiting
There are signs and symptoms of dehydration
Symptoms last for more than 2-3 days
Antibiotics have been prescribed, but symptoms have not improved within three days
The person is a young child, is elderly or has an underlying medical condition
The person is pregnant"
Bacterial Meningitis,https://ada.com/conditions/bacterial-meningitis/,,"Typical symptoms of bacterial meningitis include:Headache
Neck stiffness
Nausea
Vomiting
Fever
Sensitivity to light (photophobia)Other symptoms include drowsiness and confusion. Some  types of meningitis can cause a deep purple, blotching rash.Symptoms can come on very suddenly, and the affected person can become very sick within a few hours. If meningitis is suspected, it is best to seek medical advice as soon as possible.Symptoms of bacterial meningitis in infants and young childrenIn children, the symptoms of bacterial meningitis may be different to those in adults. The symptoms of meningitis in children may not always be clear.[1] It is important to remember that infants and very young children often cannot tell caregivers how they feel, so vigilance is important.In babies and young children, symptoms may include:[1][2]Fast breathing
Difficulty breathing
Excessive, high-pitched crying or moaning, or crying that is noticeably different from the baby’s usual cry
Irritability
Lethargy or less activity than usual
Drowsiness, sleepiness or being difficult to wake up
Refusal to eat and/or vomiting
Jerky movements and stiffness, or floppiness
High fever, above 38 C or 100.4 F, or changing body temperature, i.e. being hot and then cold
Seizures
Bulging fontanelle, the soft spot on top of a baby’s headIf seizures occur, or if the baby’s fontanelle is bulging, seek emergency medical help immediately. Small babies with a fever may not necessarily appear to be hot and may in fact shiver. Their hands or feet may be cold, and their skin may be pale, mottled or blue.[2] Children younger than one year of age do not usually have a stiff neck.[3]In young children, early symptoms indicating that meningitis is developing can include:[2]Leg pains
Cold hands or feet
Rash (see below)
Blueness, pallor or duskiness around the lips.Symptoms of bacterial meningitis in older children, teens, and adultsThe classic triad of symptoms of meningitis are a stiff neck, headache and fever, but these are not all present in all cases. However, most people with meningitis tend to have two of the four following symptoms:[1]Fever
Headache
A stiff neck
Altered mental status, for example confusion, disorientation or unusual sleepiness.Other symptoms include:[1][2][4]Pale, blotchy or bluish skin
Rash
Nausea
Vomiting
Photophobia or discomfort around bright light
Muscle pain or joint pain
Abdominal pain or diarrhea
Irritability
Seizures
Cranial nerve problems, such as nonreactive pupils
Shock, the symptoms of which include low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing and low urine outputTo check whether someone’s pupils are reactive, shine a small light, for example from a penlight, directly into the eye. If the pupils shrinks and then enlarges again when the light is removed, the pupillary reaction is normal. If this does not happen, the pupils may be nonreactive.If seizures occur, or the affected person is showing signs of altered consciousness, seek emergency medical help immediately. Seizures affect about three in every ten adults with meningitis.If the person affected has recently been taking antibiotics, some symptoms may be different or absent. People with suppressed or damaged immune systems may also not show clear signs of meningitis.[1]If it is not certain that the ill person has meningitis, but it is suspected, seek medical care immediately. It is better err on the side of caution. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have bacterial meningitis, you can do a free symptom assessment with Ada at any time.Identifying the rash associated with bacterial meningitisA rash is one of the most distinctive symptoms of bacterial meningitis in children and adults alike. Although the rash is common, it can be absent. The rash is red or purple in color, and can occur anywhere on the body, including on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. The spots may resemble tiny bruises.[2]The rash develops as small spots, which can occur in groups.[5] It is another important feature of the rash associated with bacterial meningitis that it does not go away/fade when pressed.Good to know: The so-called glass test can be carried out to check whether the rash, that the affected person has, may be a meningitis-related rash. To do this, take a clear glass and press it against an area of skin affected by the rash. If it still visible when pressure is applied, it may indicate a meningeal infection and emergency medical help should be contacted.[2]",[],"Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, the physical examination and tests which confirm the presence of a severe infection in the body. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid, the fluid in the meninges around the brain and spinal cord is taken and tested for the specific bacteria causing the infection. When bacterial meningitis is suspected, antibiotic therapy should be started right away.[1]Lumbar punctureAlso known as a spinal tap, a lumbar puncture is a crucial part of the diagnostic process for bacterial meningitis. A lumbar puncture is done to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, which is then sent for laboratory testing. Lumbar punctures are usually quite safe, though may be a little tender or painful afterwards.A lumbar puncture is done under local anesthetic, and a needle is inserted into a gap between two lumbar vertebrae in the lower back. A needle is used to draw off a small amount of fluid from around the spinal cord. The spinal cord itself is not touched.Good to know: Some affected people, especially those who have already had a seizure, are at increased risk of high intracranial pressure. Performing a lumbar puncture on someone with highly elevated intracranial pressure increases the risk of brain herniation (see FAQs). These people will require a CT scan of the head first. The attending physicians will determine who may need a CT scan.Blood and CSF testsThe CSF sample taken during the lumbar puncture will be analysed to confirm the presence of bacteria, determine what kind of bacteria are causing the infection, and determine how far along the infection is.Blood tests may also be carried out to check organ function and dehydration. These results will guide the treatment.","Bacterial meningitis is a serious condition and requires urgent medical care. The infection is treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, i.e. through a drip. People with bacterial meningitis are often very sick and may need other supportive treatment, such as fluids to increase blood pressure while the antibiotics work to fight the infection. Most people with suspected bacterial meningitis will also be isolated after being admitted to hospital.Antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningitisMost cases of bacterial meningitis are treated with intravenous antibiotics administered as soon as possible. Because the treatment often begins before the exact bacteria responsible is identified, the antibiotics used may change. Also, as some of the bacteria that cause bacterial meningitis are becoming drug-resistant, several antibiotics may have to be tried before treatment is successful. Antibiotics commonly used to treat bacterial meningitis include:[1][3]Cefotaxime
Vancomycin
Ampicillin
Ceftriaxone
Penicillin
BenzylpenicillinGood to know, although it is not an antibiotic, dexamethasone may be used in infants.Supportive treatment for bacterial meningitisPeople with meningitis will be treated as inpatients in hospital, and most will need to be in intensive care for a short time. They will be monitored for seizures, dehydration,[2] coughing or straining (which can increase intracranial pressure), pain, fever and hypotension (low blood pressure).[1] There is some evidence  that administering corticosteroids reduces inflammation, which decreases the risk of some complications.[3]","Some common causes of bacterial meningitis are preventable by vaccine. Keeping to the recommended vaccination schedule can help prevent some cases of meningitis. Good hygiene, such as washing hands, can also help to avoid some cases of bacterial meningitis.VaccinationsIn many countries, children are routinely vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae, meningococcus and pneumococcus. It is possible to be vaccinated as an adult.Post-exposure prophylactic antibioticsPeople who have been in contact with someone with bacterial meningitis, especially meningococcal meningitis and pneumococcal meningitis should be offered a short course of preventative antibiotics.[3] Rifampin or ceftriaxone in prophylactic doses is offered to:[1]Housemates and family members living with the affected person
Coworkers
Caregivers
Classmates or people in the same school dormitory
People living in the same student accommodation or military barracks
Paramedics who were in contact with the affected person",[]
Bacterial Prostatitis,https://ada.com/conditions/bacterial-prostatitis/,,"Common symptoms of bacterial prostatitis are fever, chills, a burning sensation while urinating, difficulty to start urination, and pain around the anus. Other symptoms are foul-smelling urine, weak urine flow, painful ejaculation and blood in the urine.",[],"The diagnosis is made based on the symptoms, examination of the prostate, and urine tests. Examination of the prostate involves a doctor gently putting a finger into the anus and feeling the prostate through the rectum (from behind the prostate). This can be a little painful for people with prostatitis. The urine is tested for bacteria, and this is sometimes requires prostatic massage, a procedure in which a doctor massages the prostate before the urine sample is made.","Bacterial prostatitis is treated with antibiotics. These are usually taken for 2-4 weeks. If the infection becomes persistent, longer courses of antibiotics or antibiotics through a drip (intravenous) may be needed. Pain can be managed with simple pain-relieving medication (paracetamol or ibuprofen). A urinary catheter (a tube) might be needed in case urination is difficult and very painful.",Diagnosing and effectively treating bladder infections and sexually transmitted diseases (STIs) may help prevent some episodes of bacterial prostatitis.,[]
Bacterial Sinusitis,https://ada.com/conditions/bacterial-sinusitis/,,[],"The condition is caused by bacteria that live in the nose, throat and, sometimes, the mouth. Types of bacteria which commonly cause bacterial sinusitis include:[1][2][5]Streptococcus pneumoniae
Hemophilus influenzae
Staphylococcus aureus
Moraxella catarrhalisAs detailed above, bacterial sinusitis often follows a cold or flu infection. Other conditions that can increase a person’s risk of bacterial sinusitis include:[1][4][6]Allergies
Asthma
Smoking
-Nasal obstruction, for example due to nasal polyps or a deviated nasal septum (the wall between the nasal cavities)
Congenital disease such as cystic fibrosis
Conditions which cause a weakened immune system, such as HIV infection, leukemia or immunosuppressive therapy following an organ transplant
Diabetes
Hormonal changes, for example those that occur during pregnancy
Irritating inhalants, such as cocaine
Fungal infections
Scar tissue in sinus areas, for example from nasogastric tubes or mechanical ventilation
Facial fractures
Tooth or mouth infections such as a dental abscess (infection may spread due to the close proximity of the maxillary sinuses to the upper jaw)In general, women are slightly more likely than men to get bacterial sinusitis.If you’ve had a cold or any of the disorders listed above, and you’re concerned that you may have bacterial sinusitis, check out the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.","The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and physical examination. In severe cases or cases that do not respond to treatment, a nasal endoscopy may be done to aid diagnosis and treatment.Endoscopic diagnosisAn endoscope is a small, flexible tool equipped with a camera, which allows the doctor a detailed view of the inside of the nose and sinuses. The endoscopic examination is usually done in the doctor’s office. A nasal decongestant will be administered, and the nose will be numbed by an anesthetic spray. If the endoscopic exam is not helpful or if the doctor wants to carry out further examination, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be ordered. A CT scan can be helpful in assessing the sinuses and confirming the diagnosis in complicated cases.","Most cases of bacterial sinusitis will get better without antibiotics, usually within 14 days.[4] Because of this, and because bacterial sinusitis is often caused by bacteria that are to some degree resistant to antibiotics, most doctors prefer that affected people initially try to manage the condition using home remedies and over the counter medications. Antibiotics are usually only prescribed for people who have severe or ongoing symptoms, or whose infection may be complicated by various other medical factors. Viral sinusitis does not respond to antibiotic treatment.Although most cases of bacterial sinusitis clear up without the help of  a doctor, affected people should seek medical assistance if:[2]They have a fever of 101.5F or 38C or higher
They have a bad headache that is not relieved by basic painkillers such as paracetamol
They have any signs of eye involvement (visual changes, pain moving the eyes, or any swelling or redness around the eye)
They have had symptoms for more than 10 days
Their symptoms are worsening
They have had antibiotic treatment but the symptoms persistHome remedies for bacterial sinusitisIn many cases, home remedies may be sufficient. Some people find breathing humid air or steam, such as in a warm shower, helps to relieve symptoms. Also, holding a warm pad over the painful area helps to relieve discomfort. Nasal irrigation with saline solution is helpful in reducing congestion in the nose. It is also very important to stay well-hydrated, so affected people should be sure to drink enough fluids.Over-the-counter remediesAnalgesic and anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, may help to reduce pain and swelling in the nose and face. Decongestant sprays or tablets are also often helpful in relieving symptoms. Decongestants commonly used are pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine, or corticosteroids such as fluticasone.Good to know: If over-the-counter decongestant nasal sprays or drops are being used, they should not be used for more than three days in a row as they may cause rebound congestion if used for longer. These products do not shorten the duration of bacterial sinusitis but may relieve symptoms.[6] Antihistamines are not recommended as treatment for bacterial sinusitis as they increase nasal dryness and discomfort by making mucus thicker and harder to drain.[5]Antibiotic treatment for bacterial sinusitisAntibiotic treatment is usually only needed if the infection does not improve within 7-10 days, the person has another medical condition which may affect recovery, or if:[5][6]Severe pain is present
Swelling at the front of the head, cheeks or around the eyes occurs
Nasal discharge contains blood
High fever is presentThese are indications that the bacterial infection is severe. Antibiotic treatment is usually prescribed for about 10 days, but shorter courses may be as effective, depending on the bacteria involved. The choice of which antibiotic to use will be based on which bacteria the treating physician thinks are likely to be involved in the infection.[1]Surgical treatment for bacterial sinusitisSurgery is not usually needed for acute bacterial sinusitis. It is only necessary in some cases of chronic sinusitis that do not respond to other forms of treatment. Endoscopic treatment, where a small camera-equipped probe is used to guide and perform the procedure, is one option. In this surgery, the endoscope is used to widen the natural drainage pathways in the sinuses and nose, which improves mucus drainage and cuts down on congestion and the chance of infection.[3]
Rarely, acute bacterial sinusitis may cause an abscess to form near the eye or the brain. In these cases, surgical treatment will be needed to drain the abscess.[1]Good to know: Complications from bacterial sinusitis are rare, affecting only about one in every ten thousand people with the disorder. However, they are more common among children than adults, so caregivers of children with suspected bacterial sinusitis should exercise caution and be alert for worsening symptoms, swelling or redness of any area of the child’s face.[6]","Taking care to prevent the spread of colds or the flu in the home and community can help prevent some cases of bacterial sinusitis. Seeing a dentist regularly may help to prevent tooth infections, a possible cause of bacterial sinusitis.",[]
Bacterial Vaginitis,https://ada.com/conditions/bacterial-vaginitis/,,"The most common symptom is a gray, frothy and unpleasant smelling vaginal discharge. This tends to be more than the normal vaginal discharge. Some women may develop itch and swelling of the vulva, pain while urinating or pain during sexual intercourse.",[],"Diagnosis usually is made based on the symptoms, a gynecological examination and, in some cases, a by investigating a sample of the vaginal discharge for unusual bacteria.",Treatment is a short course of antibiotics tablets. There are also antibiotics in gel form that can be put into the vagina.,"Avoiding the usage of vaginal douches, scents or deodorant may help to prevent some people from developing bacterial vaginitis.",[]
Benign Mole,https://ada.com/conditions/benign-mole/,,[],"Moles can occur anywhere on the body. They can be present at birth, but it is possible for them to develop throughout one’s lifetime. People of all ages can be born with moles, or develop new ones of any size and color throughout their lifetime. In general, however, darker skin types usually have darker moles.Most moles are made of cells called melanocytes which make a pigment called melanin.[2] Melanin has two principal functions: it helps to protect the body from ultraviolet light (UV radiation) from the sun and gives skin and hair its natural color. People with darker complexions have more of these cells, and are more likely to develop new moles after exposure to sunlight.",[],"If a dermatologist believes a melanocytic nevus needs to be evaluated further to find out whether it is cancerous, they will conduct a biopsy. This involves shaving or cutting it out so that it can be examined under the microscope. If an atypical nevus is found to contain cancerous melanocytes, the dermatologist will remove the entire mole or scar from the biopsy site by cutting out the entire area, as well as a rim of normal skin around it. They will then suture the wound (stitch the wound to close it). This treatment is carried out to ensure that any melanoma-containing cells are removed in their entirety, preventing melanoma from spreading elsewhere in the body.Removing benign molesEven though benign moles do not pose health risks such as melanomas, many people opt to have them removed. Most people who seek to have nevi removed do so for cosmetic reasons, for instance, if one is embarrassed about how a particular mole or moles look, or practical reasons such as if they snag on clothing or impede shaving.Scarring is a possible consequence of removing a nevus. With scarring in mind, its location and the likely aesthetic development of the scar should be considered before removal, especially in cases where the procedure has been sought for cosmetic reasons.Methods of mole removal include:Common methods of removing nevi include burning them off with an electric current which passes through a wire that becomes hot and is used to burn off the upper layers of the skin. The heat helps prevent bleeding. More than one treatment may be needed to remove a nevus.Alternatively, the nevus can be cut or ""shaved"" off the skin. Some nevi may have subcutaneous cells (which reside underneath the skin), so the doctor might need to make a deeper cut to remove the entire mole to prevent it from growing back. The cut may require stitches.Nevi can also be frozen off with liquid nitrogen. The dermatologist will swab or spray a small amount of super-cold liquid nitrogen on the mole or skin tag. After it has been frozen off, there might be a blister at the site where it was, but this usually heals on its own.","By taking appropriate measures to avoid sun damage, a person can:Prevent new nevi from developing
Prevent existing melanocytic nevi from developing melanoma skin cancerWhen spending time in direct sunlight, always:Wear sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF), such as SPF 50
Use sun-protective clothing, such as wide-brimmed hats, sleeves and long pants
Seek shade regularly
Stay out of the sunlight between peak hours, (around 10am to 4pm)Check the body several times per year, particularly after periods of sun exposure, for any new atypical moles or atypical changes to existing moles, which could indicate melanoma.","Q: Can a benign mole grow back after removal?
A: If a mole has been removed by cutting it off so that it is level with the skin, some cells may remain below the skin. These can act as a “seed” and cause it to regrow. It is not possible to predict whether it will grow back. The chances of this are greatly reduced if care is taken to remove the subcutaneous cells during the initial procedure.Q: Can a benign mole become cancerous?
A: Melanomas can develop anywhere in the surface of the skin, including sites occupied by benign moles or within the melanocytic tissue of the mole itself. For this reason, it is important to consult a physician if a mole undergoes any changes, as these may be signs that it has become cancerous.**Q: Can a benign mole change color? **
A: Yes. Most commonly, moles change color over time by getting darker after exposure to sunlight. This is not necessarily a cause for concern, but could indicate the presence of melanoma, so it is advisable to consult a doctor."
Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,https://ada.com/conditions/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/,,"Recurrent, short attacks of dizziness are the main symptom of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The dizziness associated with vertigo often feels like the world is spinning, rather than a feeling of lightheadedness. The dizziness may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and a loss of balance. The attacks often occur after changing position of the head, such as suddenly turning the head, or moving from lying to sitting.",[],Diagnosis is made by a doctor with the help of a physical examination. The diagnosis can be confirmed with specific tests.,"This form of dizziness can be treated with certain repositioning maneuvers (Epley maneuvers or Brandt-Daroff exercises). During these series of controlled exercises, symptoms may get worse. After being instructed by the doctor in how to do them, people can do some of these exercises at home. Normally BPPV can be treated well in this manner. Medication is not used to treat BPPV, though might be helpful in managing nausea associated with the dizziness. In severe persistent cases surgery may be an option.","People with BPPV may need to avoid certain activities or movements which bring on an episode of dizziness, as the dizziness may make these activities unsafe.",[]
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,https://ada.com/conditions/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/,,"The most common symptoms of BPH are related to urination. They include:[3]The need to urinate frequently, including at night
Strong urges to urinate, that appear suddenly and may lead to urinary leakage
A weak or interrupted urine stream
Urinary dribbling (where urine slowly leaks out after urination, due to incomplete emptying of the bladder)
The sensation that the bladder is never truly empty (incomplete voiding)
Pain while urinating
Red-tinted urine due to presence of small amounts of red blood cells in urineThe symptoms of BPH can vary in severity. Some men will experience extremely mild symptoms that require no treatment, while in rarer cases, others – typically those with a full blockage of the urethra – will find it impossible or extremely difficult to urinate.","The exact cause of BPH is unknown, but it is thought mainly to be linked to hormonal changes. Many of these changes naturally affect older men, e.g. declining testosterone levels, which lead to a greater (relative) level of estrogen in the bloodstream.[1]Some experts believe that a family history of prostate irregularities puts some men at greater risk of developing BPH. Certain genetic factors also seem to play a role in the development of BPH.[4]","Diagnosing BPH will typically begin with the doctor taking a medical history, including questions to find out if the affected person has a family history of prostate problems, followed by a full medical examination.The examination will include a digital rectal examination (internal examination of the rectum), through which the doctor will be able to estimate the size, shape and health of the prostate. The rectal examination will also be used to check for the presence of prostate cancer, which, while unconnected to BPH, can be experienced simultaneously with the condition. Other exams and tests may include:[5]Urinalysis: Testing a sample of urine to check for a bladder infection which may be causing the symptoms.
Blood tests: To check the levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a protein produced by the prostate that may increase in volume in men with BPH and prostate cancer. In some cases blood values related to kidney function may also be tested, as the kidneys can sometimes be affected e.g. in cases of severe urinary obstruction.
Uroflowmetry: To check the rate of urine flow during urination. The normal maximal urinary flow rate is more than 15 ml per second. Maximal flow rates of less than 15 ml per second indicate an obstruction at the bladder outlet. Maximal flow rates of less than 10 ml per second (due to BPH) indicate the need for surgery.[1]
Abdominal ultrasound: This imaging technique may be used to detect factors such as increased total prostate volume, an elevated post-void residual urine volume (e.g. more than 100 ml), thickening of the bladder wall and hydronephrosis (swelling of a kidney due to a build up of urine).[1]
Transrectal ultrasound: This imaging technique requires insertion of an ultrasound probe into the rectum of the affected individual. It is carried out only if prostate cancer is suspected, for example in cases of abnormal digital rectal exam results, or elevated serum PSA.","A variety of treatment options for BPH exist, including medication, minimally invasive therapy and surgery. The treatment route chosen will depend on:[6]The severity of the condition
Age
General health
The size of the prostateConservative treatmentIn people with mildly symptomatic BPH, observation of the condition over time, accompanied by some behavioural changes (outlined below) may be sufficient. These behavioural changes may also be employed as a supplementary therapy, for people undergoing medical treatment for BPH. Helpful behavioural changes include:Restricting fluid intake before bedtime, and before leaving the house
Choosing non-caffeinated and non-alcoholic beverages
Ensuring the bladder is completely empty by passing urine in the sitting position and double voiding (emptying the bladder twice to ensure complete urination).[7]MedicationMedication is the most common method of treating BPH. Options include:Alpha blockers: These drugs relax bladder and urethra muscles, easing urination. They are generally more effective in men with smaller prostates and tend to work rapidly. Side-effects may include dizziness and retrograde ejaculation – a harmless condition in which semen is sent to the bladder instead of being released from the penis.
5-alpha reductase inhibitors: These drugs work by reducing the size of the prostate. They may take roughly six months to become effective and may also cause retrograde ejaculation.
Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors: e.g. Tadalafil. Although this drug is more typically prescribed to treat erectile dysfunction, it has also shown success in treating symptoms of BPH. It is generally only prescribed to those experiencing BPH and erectile dysfunction simultaneously.In some cases, the doctor may prescribe a combination of drugs.Minimally invasive surgeryFor those experiencing moderate to severe BPH, or in cases where medication has proven to be unsuccessful, a range of minimally invasive surgical therapies are available. These include:Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP): Incisions are made in the prostate by passing a lighted scope (tubular viewing instrument) up the urethra, allowing urine to pass more easily through the urethra.
Transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT): An electrode is passed into the prostate and microwaves are emitted in order to shrink the prostate. This therapy can ease urine flow.[8][9]
Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA): Radio waves are passed through needles which have been inserted into the prostate, heating and reducing excess tissue.
Laser therapy: A laser is used to destroy excess prostate tissue, quickly relieving the symptoms of BPH.
Interventions such as the Urolift® system,[10] a non-surgical proprietary device that uses tiny implants to lift the prostate away from the urethra and thereby relieve BPH symptoms that result from pressure on the urethra.Classical surgeryThose with severe symptoms or those for whom other treatment methods have proven unsuccessful may require surgery to treat BPH.Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): By passing a lighted scope up the urethra, a surgeon removes the majority of the prostate. This usually relieves the symptoms of BPH, however, a catheter may be required until the operation site has fully healed.
Open prostatectomy: This is an inpatient procedure in which an incision is made in the abdomen or perineal area, allowing a surgeon access to the prostate to remove excess tissue. It is common for those with a very large prostate or other complicating factors that rule out other treatment options.","The two main causes of BPH – aging and genetics – cannot be avoided, meaning the condition is difficult to prevent. However, leading a healthy lifestyle may delay the onset of the condition or help manage its symptoms. Lifestyle choices that may help include:[11]Maintaining a healthy diet: Fruits and vegetables are high in antioxidants, polyphenols, vitamins and minerals – all substances that may help fight inflammation and reduce the risk of an enlarged prostate. Avoiding fatty, sugary and additive-heavy foods may also help with this.
Maintaining a healthy weight: Some studies have drawn a link between being overweight and BPH. Regular exercise can help with this.
Managing stress: Some studies have suggested that hormonal changes associated with stress may contribute to the onset of BPH.
Don’t wait to urinate: Delaying urination may worsen the symptoms of BPH and can, in some cases, lead to a urinary tract infection.Although these lifestyle factors may help delay or manage BPH, even very healthy men can develop BHP, and these preventative measures offer no guarantee against this condition.","Q: Is BPH linked to erectile dysfunction?
A: BPH and erectile dysfunction (ED) are separate problems. However, certain medications used to treat BPH may lead to ED, while, conversely, certain medications used to treat ED can help with BPH. A doctor can help to outline the right treatment plan for an individual.[13]Q: Are there any natural treatment methods for BPH?
A: A number of natural products are thought by some to help treat BPH. These include:[14]Saw palmetto: A herbal remedy that has historically been used to treat urinary problems.
Beta-sitosterol: A mixture of plant extracts containing sitosterol, a cholesterol-like substance thought to help with the symptoms of BPH.
Pygeum: The bark from the African plum tree which has historically been used to treat urinary problems.
Rye grass pollen extract: An extract made from three types of grass pollen that is thought to help relieve the symptoms of BPH.It is important to note that such natural treatments are not guaranteed to help prevent BPH or relieve its symptoms, nor should they be seen as an alternative to normal treatment methods. A doctor should always be consulted before using natural treatment methods."
Bipolar Disorder,https://ada.com/conditions/bipolar-affective-disorder/,,"People with bipolar disorder experience mania (highs) and depression (lows). For more information on the following points, also see our signs of bipolar disorder resource.ManiaManic episodes can feel like an intense state of wellbeing, with unusual reserves of energy. However, mania can cause people to lose touch with day-to-day reality and with how other people feel. After a manic episode, people can feel embarrassed or ashamed about their behavior and unable to manage plans that were made while experiencing mania.HypomaniaThe symptoms of hypomania are similar to mania, but less extreme. Episodes of hypomania last for a few days rather than weeks or months, as is common with mania. It is unusual to have any psychotic symptoms with hypomania.DepressionPeriods of extreme low mood or depression can last for at least two weeks, with symptoms interfering with day-to-day life.The contrast between the ‘high’ of mania or hypomania may make an episode of depression even harder to cope with.Mixed featuresMixed features, also known as mixed episodes or mixed states, are when people feel symptoms of depression and mania or hypomania at the same time.Psychotic symptomsIn very severe cases, symptoms of psychosis may develop. In a psychotic episode, a person loses touch with reality. They may see, hear or believe things that the people around them do not.","The causes of bipolar disorder are not yet fully understood. Lifetime prevalence is around 3 to 5 percent.There appears to be a genetic link, as the chance of developing bipolar disorder is greater if a family member is also affected.[9] If one parent has bipolar disorder, there is a 25 percent chance a child will develop it. If both parents have bipolar disorder there is a chance of up to 50 percent that a child will develop bipolar disorder.[10]Bipolar disorder may be caused by a problem with the way the brain controls mood. This is why medication is often used to control symptoms.High-stress situations and life-changing events may trigger an episode of depression or mania.[11]","There is no medical or blood test to diagnose bipolar disorder. A doctor or other mental health practitioner will make a diagnosis based on conversations with the person affected.[12]DSM-5 criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition) for diagnosing bipolar disorder require one episode of mania, or one episode of hypomania and one episode of depression.[5]ICD-10 criteria (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, tenth revision) for diagnosing bipolar disorder require two or more episodes of significantly disturbed activity, consisting of mania, or hypomania and depression. The ICD-10 also classifies episodes of only mania or hypomania as bipolar.[13]It is possible for a person with bipolar disorder to experience an initial episode of depression, and they will therefore not be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In such cases, treatment with antidepressants may trigger a first episode of mania.","There is no known cure for bipolar disorder. Treatment aims to stabilize mood and prevent episodes of mania and depression from becoming extreme and to allow the individual to live without disruption.Medical treatments for bipolar disorderMedications to stabilize mood are a common way of treating bipolar disorder. Some people with the condition need a combination of medications to control mood swings in the most effective way for them.[5][14][15]LithiumLithium has been used to stabilize moods for over 50 years, though how it works isn’t fully known. It is mainly used for preventing and stabilizing mania by evening out mood swings, although it can also be prescribed to treat depression.[16]Getting the right dose for each person is very important. If the dose is too low, the drug won’t be effective. If the dose is too high, lithium becomes toxic. People taking lithium need regular blood tests to check the dosage and to ensure the kidneys and thyroid are working properly.Side effects of normal dosage can include:[17][18]Feeling thirsty
Urinating more often than usual
Nausea
Feeling tired
Gaining weight
Slightly shaky hands
Hypothyroidism and goiter (enlarged thyroid gland) can develop with long term useIf there is too much lithium in the body, side effects can include:Feeling very thirsty
Diarrhea or vomiting
Noticeable shaking of limbs
Muscle twitches
Being confusedThe amount of lithium in the body is affected by how much liquid and salt the person takes in. Drinking plenty of non-alcoholic fluids and avoiding a low salt diet is recommended.Lithium use is declining in the United States because of concerns over its side effects and the availability of medications like valproate. However, it is still considered an effective treatment.[19]Taking lithium reduces the chances of having a manic episode within the next year by 30 to 40 percent.Anticonvulsant medicationValproate is an anticonvulsant medication which was originally developed to treat epilepsy. It is increasingly used to treat bipolar disorder as a mood stabilizer, particularly in the United States. It is not yet clear how the drug works.Valproate is used to treat mania, rapid cycling and mixed episodes. It is sometimes prescribed along with lithium, as there is a suggestion that the two work more effectively together.[20]Valproate can cause damage to a developing fetus, and should not be taken by women of childbearing age.[21]Other side effects may include:Nausea
Feeling shaky
Diarrhea
Increased appetite and associated weight gain
Changes to levels of ammonia and platelets in the bloodCarbamazepine and lamotrigine are anticonvulsants that are also used as mood stabilizers. Carbamazepine is thought to be more effective at treating rapid cycling than lithium and causes fewer side effects. Lamotrigine is generally prescribed for treating bipolar II disorder.[14]Antipsychotic medicationAntipsychotic medications, such as olanzapine and quetiapine, are used to treat mania. They can also be used in conjunction with mood stabilizers to prevent mania occurring.[22]Antipsychotic medications help by treating psychotic symptoms, such as hearing voices, delusions and racing thoughts. They can also help to prevent extreme mood swings and, in some cases, can be used to treat severe depression.[15]These medications work by blocking dopamine in the brain. Side effects may include:Feeling sleepy and sluggish
Weight gain
Lack of interest in sexual activity
Increased chance of developing diabetes
High doses can cause limbs to be stiff and shakyAntidepressantsAntidepressant medications are used to treat moderate to severe episodes of depression.For some people, there is a risk that treatment with antidepressants alone can trigger an episode of mania or make rapid cycling more likely. For this reason, it’s recommended that antidepressants, such as fluoxetine[23],  should be prescribed alongside a mood stabilizer.[24]SSRI antidepressants can take two to six weeks to start affecting mood. They are thought to work by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain.There are many potential side effects when using SSRIs, though most wear off after a few weeks. These side effects include:[15][23]Anxiety
Nausea
Upset stomach
Dizziness
Not sleeping enough or sleeping too much
Low sex driveIt is important not to stop taking SSRIs too soon so as to prevent a recurrence of depression. A course of six to nine months is usually recommended, though in more severe cases, it may be advisable to continue taking SSRIs for longer. A doctor should be consulted before stopping treatment with SSRIs.[25][26]Cognitive treatments for bipolar disorderIn between episodes of mania, or hypomania and depression, cognitive, or psychotherapy, treatments can help. Psychotherapy usually takes place in sessions of one hour over periods of several months.[26]Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)Cognitive behavioral therapy is a form of talking therapy that focuses on how thoughts and beliefs affect feelings and behavior. CBT teaches participants coping skills to recognize and deal with problems.[27]For people with bipolar disorder, CBT can help improve awareness of behavior, compliance with treatment plans and day-to-day coping skills. When used alongside medication, a study of 19 randomized control trials found that CBT is effective in reducing the relapse rate and the severity of symptoms.[28]Self monitoringLearning to recognize signs of moods swinging out of control is an important step in managing bipolar disorder. Recognizing early signs can lead to intervention and prevent full episodes of mania and depression, and avoid potential hospitalization.Keeping a mood diary is helpful to track long-term mood changes, as well as possible triggers.Other forms of psychotherapyPsychoeducation can help by providing more information about bipolar disorder to the person with the condition, as well as their family and friends.[29]Led by a therapist, group psychoeducation brings together people with similar experiences to share knowledge about how bipolar disorder can affect behavior and how to manage symptoms.Family therapy can help by working together as a family to strengthen relationships, identify risks and develop support skills.Other treatments for bipolar disorderThere are other potential treatments for bipolar disorder if medication and psychotherapeutic interventions are not successful, or if the condition is extreme.Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)Electroconvulsive therapy is a treatment that sends electrical current through the brain to trigger an epileptic seizure. The electricity is administered under general anesthetic and with the use of muscle relaxants, so the body does not convulse.[30]ECT is only advised for rapid, short-term relief of severe depression, mania or psychosis, where other interventions have failed and/or when the condition is considered life-threatening.ECT causes memory loss, which is usually short-term but can be very disorienting.New treatmentsThere is ongoing research into new mood-stabilizing drugs. Other, non-medication therapies, are also being investigated, including vagal nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation and light therapy.Self care in the management of bipolar disorderAs well as monitoring day-to-day behavior for signs of mood changes, the knowledge gained from such monitoring can be used to avoid triggering an episode of mania or depression.[31]It can help to have someone to confide in. Close relationships with people who understand the condition and the individual’s experience and trigger points, can be useful as a support network.Too much activity can trigger a manic episode, so it’s helpful to maintain a balance between work and activity, and relaxation and fun.Stress and bipolar disorderStress is a common trigger, and avoiding highly stressful situations is recommended. However, it’s not possible to avoid all stress, so a useful tool may be to learn relaxation techniques or take advice on handling stress from a qualified therapist.[32][33]Healthy lifestyleThere is no specific diet recommended for bipolar disorder. However, maintaining a healthy diet will help with overall wellness.[34][35] This includes:Eating a balance of foods rich in nutrients, such as fruits, vegetables, pulses, whole grains, fish, eggs, low-fat meat, nuts and seeds
Avoiding food that is high in saturated and trans fats, such as red meat, as well as simple carbohydrates such as refined sugarLithium can affect salt levels in the body, so care should be taken not to eat too much or too little.[17]Caffeine may contribute to a manic or hypomanic episode by disrupting normal sleep patterns.[36]Exercising for 20 minutes, three times a week, helps to maintain fitness. Exercise also releases endorphins into the brain, which improve mood.[37]",[],"Q: What is a bipolar personality?
A: Someone with bipolar disorder experiences extreme mood swings, from depressive lows to manic highs. These mood swings are more severe than those which people without bipolar disorder experience, and at worst, need to be treated in hospital. Bipolar is a condition, rather than a personality type. It needs treatment to allow someone to live a life free from disruption.Q: What’s the difference between depression and bipolar?
A: Someone with bipolar disorder experiences manic episodes alongside depression. Someone with depression without mania does not have bipolar disorder.  (See Diagnosing bipolar disorder.)Q: Why is bipolar disorder sometimes called manic depression?
A: Manic depression is an old name for bipolar disorder, and comes from the two emotional states: mania and depression. Healthcare professionals now use the term bipolar, which also refers to the two extremes of emotional states.Q: Is bipolar disorder a disability?
A: Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition. With effective treatment, it shouldn’t have a large effect on day-to-day life. However, if the symptoms of bipolar disorder are so severe that it interferes with everyday living or the ability to work, social security benefits may be available.[45]Q: Can you work if you have bipolar disorder?
A: With effective treatment to keep symptoms under control, someone with bipolar disorder can continue to work as normal. If symptoms are not under control, it may affect:[45]Working with other people
Concentration and memory
Understanding
Standards of behaviorIn these circumstances, someone with bipolar disorder may find it difficult to work and may need time to recover.Q: Is bipolar disorder curable?
A: Bipolar disorder is not curable, but symptoms can be controlled with treatment. (See Treatment of bipolar disorder.) Factors including effectiveness of treatment, social circumstances and genetics may mean that a person with bipolar disorder may experience only one or two episodes in a lifetime. Other people may experience bipolar disorder as a chronic lifetime condition.Q: How do you know if you have bipolar disorder?
A: People with bipolar disorder experience extremes of emotion and mood, unlike others. If you think you have bipolar disorder, a doctor or other mental health professional can talk to you about it. (See Diagnosing bipolar disorder.)Q: How do people act when they have bipolar disorder?
A: Unless someone with bipolar disorder is experiencing a manic or depressive episode, their behavior won’t be out of the ordinary. If someone is having a manic episode, you might notice their conversation is faster than usual, their train of thought jumps around and they’re easily distracted. They might also be sleeping less, be irritable and thinking up outlandish plans and adventures. (See Mania.) If someone is depressed, they may be slow and lacking motivation, have no interest in activities they usually enjoy and/or be tearful and upset. (See Depression.)Q: Can you treat bipolar naturally?
A: Psychotherapy is recommended as a long-term treatment for bipolar as a way to manage and be aware of changing moods. Relaxation methods, like meditation may help maintain a healthy, balanced lifestyle. However, medication is recommended for stabilizing moods and particularly for treating mania. St John’s Wort, a commonly used complementary therapy for depression, may actually make psychotic symptoms worse.[46]Q: What famous people have bipolar disorder?
A: Singer Demi Lovato[47], actors Jean-Claude Van Damme[48] and Catherine Zeta-Jones[49] and British actor, writer and comedian Stephen Fry[50] all have bipolar disorder. Winston Churchill is believed to have had the condition[51]. Carrie Fisher had bipolar disorder and often spoke openly about it[52].Q: Are bipolar disorder and ADHD related?
A: ADHD is a behavioral disorder with symptoms present all the time whereas bipolar is a mood disorder with episodic symptoms. Although symptoms of mania are similar to those of ADHD, the two disorders are not the same.[53]Q: Can bipolar disorder cause hallucinations?
A: If someone is experiencing psychosis during a manic episode, they may hallucinate. (See Psychotic symptoms.)Q: Is bipolar disorder inherited?
A:  The causes of the condition are not yet fully understood. There may be a genetic link with bipolar disorder as it does seem to run in families, but this hasn’t been confirmed."
Bladder Cancer,https://ada.com/conditions/bladder-cancer/,,"Typical symptoms include blood in the urine (hematuria) and urination problems, such as pain when urinating, urinating more frequently and feeling a sudden urge to urinate. Some people may have recurring urinary tract infections (bladder or kidney infections). Other symptoms may include pain low in the belly or in the back and swelling of the legs.",[],"Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and, occasionally, the physical examination. A urine analysis can be done to look for blood and cancer cells in the urine. A cystoscopy (looking at the inside of the bladder with a camera) will be done to confirm the diagnosis and to take a sample of the cancer for further investigation. A computed tomography (CT) scan is also helpful in investigating whether the cancer has spread to other locations.","Treatment of bladder cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer.

These people may find they experience similar problems in different relationships. They may also be involved in risky behaviors, such as drug consumption, eating disorders, and a tendency to cause themselves harm.",[],"The diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is made after a thorough psychological assessment, which considers multiple aspects of a person's life. The diagnosis is often difficult as people with borderline personality disorder have often had multiple complicated experiences which have formed their personality. To make the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, a doctor should exclude other causes for the symptoms, such as depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder.","Therapy aims to teach people with these personality traits how to manage difficulties and relationships and how to manage impulsive behavior. This is usually done by a psychologist. It can take time for a person with BPD to learn new ways of dealing with problems, but this therapy can be effective if a person is determined. Medications might be prescribed to help symptoms of depression or anxiety, because people with BPD often also have these conditions.","It is difficult to prevent borderline personality disorder.

Some people experience persistent hiccups, nausea, vomiting or breathing difficulties.",[],"The diagnosis is usually made by an experienced doctor or neurologist based on the symptoms, a clinical examination, and a CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of the brain. A Doppler ultrasound of the neck arteries and an angiography may also be performed to look for blockages in other blood vessels. Other tests may include an electrocardiogram and blood tests for kidney and liver function.","A possible brain stem infarct requires urgent review by a doctor. The treatment is dependent on the type of infarct, and symptoms. If bleeding has caused the stroke, this may need to be stopped using a clip or coil. If blockage in a blood vessel has caused the stroke, these can be dissolved with help of medication. The long-term treatment depends on the consequences of the stroke, but physical therapy and speech therapy are helpful. Some people may need to take medication to thin the blood in order to prevent another stroke.","Regular exercise, losing weight, and giving up smoking, alcohol or drug abuse can help prevent the chances of a stroke.

Other symptoms include thickening or puckering of the skin of the breast, a change in the shape of the nipple, or a rash over the nipple. Many people with early breast cancer will have no symptoms at all, so screening (testing people with no symptoms) is important.",[],"Diagnosis is usually made during mammography screening. Mammography is an X-ray of the breast. If a lump is seen at mammography or felt, a small sample of the lump is removed and tested to see if it is cancer.

CT Angiogram,https://ada.com/ct-angiogram/,,[],[],[],[],[],"Q: Is CTA safe?
A: The radiation-related risks associated with CTA are far outweighed by the benefits. CTA gives doctors the ability to make rapid and accurate diagnoses and prescribe appropriate treatments for otherwise harder-to-identify conditions. However, care must still be taken to minimize the exposure to radiation from the X-ray equipment. Being exposed to X-rays is often associated with an increased risk of developing cancer later on.It is advisable to limit the number of X-rays performed on a single person — including those associated with CTA  — to those which are absolutely necessary. However, CT scanners have sophisticated radiation dose controls to minimize the risk of developing cancer as much as possible. Furthermore, it is possible to opt for a low-dose radiation X-ray in all cases where a lesser quality CT angiogram will be sufficient to make a diagnosis.Q: Is CTA suitable for someone who is pregnant?
A: In the early stages of pregnancy, the foetus is most at risk of experiencing adverse effects from being exposed to the ionizing radiation involved in CTA. For this reason, it is recommended that pregnant women do not undergo CTA during the first fifteen weeks of their pregnancy, if the purpose of the scan is to produce an angiogram showing a section of the body which includes the gravid uterus (the area containing the foetus).From fifteen weeks post-conception, the foetus is considered to have developed sufficiently for there to be a negligible risk of damage from exposure to the ionizing radiation involved in a single scan. At this point, it is generally considered that the risk of damage to the unborn child is outweighed by the benefits of performing a CT angiogram in order to diagnose and treat any conditions which may affect the mother and unborn child if left untreated. There is no reason for a pregnant woman to avoid contrast material at any point in the pregnancy, so intravenous contrast material can be administered as needed.[6]Q: Is CTA suitable for children
A: Due to technological advances, contemporary CTA can be performed even on newborn children. The range of reasons that CTA is usually performed on children is narrower than for adults. In children, CTA is most often used to assess congenital diseases (birth defects), postoperative vascular diseases (abnormal conditions that can develop in the blood vessels and veins as a result of surgery) and cardiac diseases. One advantage of performing CTA on children is that it can be possible to avoid long periods of sedation, which are associated with MRI angiography and reduce high-intensity radiation exposure, which is associated with regular angiography.[7] If you are concerned about the health of you or a loved one, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app."
CT Scan,https://ada.com/ct-scan/,,[],[],[],[],[],"Q: How is a CT scan different from an MRI scan?
A: The principal difference between CT scans and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans is that CT scans use X-rays to produce their images, while MRI scans use radio frequency pulses and magnetic fields. The MRI scanner is shaped like a tube and surrounds the whole body at once. An MRI scanner is more likely to make a person feel claustrophobic than the ring-shaped CT scanner. However, the images produced by MRI scans have the potential to reveal any difference between normal and abnormal non-skeletal tissue more clearly than images from a CT scan.For someone who has been prescribed a scan, there are several factors to consider in order to decide whether a CT scan or an MRI scan is the most suitable option for their needs. The doctor will decide whether CT or MRI scanning is suitable on a case-by-case basis.[4]Q: Are the X-rays from the CT scanner dangerous?
A: Exposure to the high-intensity radiation involved in X-rays is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer later on. It is therefore advisable to limit the number of X-rays performed on a person to what is absolutely necessary. To combat the risk of cancer from exposure to radiation, CT scanners have sophisticated radiation dose controls. Furthermore, it is possible to opt for a low-dose radiation X-ray/CT scan in cases where a lesser-quality CT scan image will be sufficient to make a diagnosis. The radiation-related risks associated with CT scans are far outweighed by their benefits. CT scans give doctors the ability to rapidly make correct diagnoses and prescribe appropriate treatments for otherwise unidentifiable or much harder or only much later identifiable conditions.[5]Q: Does an angiogram involve a CT scan?
A: An angiogram may involve a CT scan, depending on the type of angiography technique recommended by a person’s doctor. Angiography is used to look at the blood vessels and to detect any problems related to blood flow around the body. CT angiography (CTA) is an imaging technique which produces pictures of virtual slices of the body, which can be used to examine blood flow and related problems. It is also possible to examine the blood vessels using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography.An important advantage of CT angiography over MRI angiography is that it is possible for the radiologist to view and evaluate bones, soft tissues and blood vessels all at the same time. This increases the possibility that a single angiography session will be enough to reveal everything that the doctor needs to know in order to accurately diagnose and properly treat the affected person."
CT Scan (Head),https://ada.com/ct-scan-head/,,[],[],[],[],[],"Q: What are the risks of undergoing a CT scan of the head?
A: CT scanning involves exposure to some X-ray radiation. Doctors generally agree that the risks are low compared to the potential risk of not being diagnosed with a dangerous health problem. The risk from a single scan is small, but it increases if an individual has many X-rays or CT scans over time. Newer imaging scanners can make it possible to encounter less exposure to radiation than older models.Q: I am pregnant. Will undergoing a CT scan of the head affect my unborn child?
A: Although the risk of damage from radiation is usually considered insignificant in comparison to the benefits of performing the scan, it is advisable to tell the doctor if the person undergoing the scan is pregnant. They may be able to avoid exposing the unborn child to radiation completely by examining the head using other tests which do not involve such a high level of exposure to radiation, such as a head MRI scan or ultrasound.Q: Can the head and neck be assessed during the same CT scan?
A: The head and neck can be assessed during the same procedure. It is particularly common after an accident for a CT scan or X-ray to be used to check for damage to the bones in the person's neck and head at the same time. If all possible conditions can be screened for using a CT scan, the head and neck will be assessed during the same procedure. Otherwise, the neck can be assessed separately, using whatever method of scanning is most appropriate to screen for the suspected condition(s).Q: What is the difference between a CT scan of the head and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan?
A: The principal difference between CT and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning is that CT scans use X-rays to produce their images, while MRI scans use radio frequency pulses and magnetic fields. The MRI scanner is shaped like a tube and surrounds the whole body at once. An MRI scanner is more likely to make a person feel claustrophobic than the ring-shaped CT scanner. However, the images produced by MRI scans have the potential to reveal any difference between normal and abnormal non-skeletal tissue more clearly than images from a CT scan.A CT scan is more likely than an MRI scan to be used to investigate acute health issues as it is faster to perform. An MRI scan is more likely than an CT scan to be used for investigating soft tissue abnormalities.For someone who has been prescribed a scan, there are several factors to consider; most importantly, what condition(s) or changes are being scanned for; in order to decide whether a CT scan or an MRI scan is the most suitable option. Based on an assessment of a person’s medical history and the diagnostic and/or imaging purpose of the scan, the doctor will decide whether CT or MRI scanning is suitable.[4]"

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS),https://ada.com/conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/,,"The symptoms of CTS are usually worse at night and may be absent during the day. They can be intensified or brought on by forceful activities involving the wrist, especially the use of vibrating tools and heavy lifting. The most common symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are:[4]Numbness and tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and the radial half of the ring finger (the half of the ring finger closest to the palm, which is supplied by the median nerve). This can result in atrophy of the affected muscles (which may appear flattened).
Burning pain in the wrist
Loss of grip strength and dexterityProximal radiation (the sensation that the pain has radiated to nearby areas) is a less common, but not unusual, symptom of CTS. People may experience pain related to CTS in the volar forearm (the side of the forearm that is on the same side as the palm of the hand), medial arm (the skin on the side of the arm where the medial brachial cutaneous nerve is) and shoulder.The symptoms of CTS worsen the longer the condition is left untreated. If a person is affected by CTS for several months, they may begin to feel numbness in the hand on a permanent basis and lose the ability to feel hot and cold sensations with the hand.Seek medical attention promptly if any of the symptoms of CTS are present, in order to diagnose and begin treating the condition  at an early stage.Acute carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)Acute carpal tunnel syndrome is a version of CTS in which the median nerve is severely crushed, usually as the result of an injury or chronic health condition. Unlike regular CTS, acute CTS requires urgent surgical intervention to prevent serious health consequences, such as the permanent loss of sensation or movement in the affected area.[5]Factors which are associated with the development of acute CTS include:[5]Fractures and fracture dislocations around the wrist
Vascular disorders (diseases affecting the blood vessels)
Hemorrhagic conditions (conditions relating to abnormal blood flow or clotting)
Rheumatologic disorders (conditions relating to pain and stiffness in the body, such as arthritis and Crohn’s disease)
Anomalous anatomy (atypical wrist or nerve structure)","Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by the median nerve (the nerve which controls sensation and movement in the hands) becoming compressed. Any medical conditions and/or injuries which cause swelling in the wrist can reduce the amount of space inside the carpal tunnel, causing pressure to be exerted on the median nerve and activating the symptoms of CTS.The biological cause of CTS is the swelling of a protective lining of tendons called the tenosynovium within the carpal tunnel. This sets off a chain of related changes within the carpal tunnel:[6]The swelling of the tendons is understood to cause a buildup of synovial fluid (the fluid which normally protects and lubricates the tendons) within the carpal tunnel.
In reaction to this buildup of fluid, a band across the top of the carpal tunnel called the transverse ligament becomes thicker and broader.
The swelling and the enlarged transverse ligament exert pressure on the median nerve, depriving it of the blood supply and oxygen it needs in order to function normally. This causes the median nerve to become damaged and the symptoms of CTS to develop.The medical or circumstantial basis for these developments occurring in the carpal tunnel is unknown in many cases, and there is no test available to identify a specific cause. However, the development of CTS may be caused by factors including:[1]Work-related activities: In particular, CTS may be attributed to activities which involve repetitive movements, heavy lifting and using vibrating tools. Professional activities which are particularly associated with CTS include assembly work, farming, sewing, cleaning, and meat packing.
Heredity: People born with smaller bone structures are more likely to have wrist and bone structures in which the median nerve is susceptible to the compression that causes CTS. A genetic predisposition to any of the many medical conditions which are linked to CTS may be described as the indirect cause of CTS in a person who develops CTS as a result of another medical condition.[7]
Medical conditions: Musculoskeletal disorders (conditions affecting the muscles and/or skeleton) and autoimmune diseases may trigger the development of CTS by causing inflammation in the hands and wrists. The main medical conditions which are linked to CTS are diseases of the thyroid gland, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney insufficiency, Down syndrome, osteoarthritis and obesity. If CTS is caused by a medical condition, it may be alleviated by effectively treating the causal condition.[6]
Pregnancy: Pregnant women sometimes develop CTS due to hormonal changes and fluid retention. If CTS is caused by pregnancy alone, it will often go away when the pregnancy ends. Rest, ice, elevation and exercise may all help to alleviate the symptoms of CTS during pregnancy.[8]The use of some medications has been linked to CTS, but more research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which these may cause CTS to develop. Medications which have been linked to CTS include:[6]Medications which affect the immune system (such as interleukin-2)
Medications which prevent blood clotting (such as warfarin)","To diagnose CTS, a doctor will usually perform a physical exam on the hand(s) and wrist(s) and ask about the symptoms a person has been experiencing. The purpose of the physical exam is to find out whether a person is experiencing physical sensations that typically relate to the median nerve being compressed.If these sensations are not present, this can rule out a diagnosis of CTS and the possibility that a person is affected by another condition can be investigated. During the physical exam, doctors look out for:Weak muscles surrounding the thumb (which can happen in cases of CTS due to underusing these muscles in order to avoid the pain that often accompanies movement)
Tinel’s sign: Tingling and numbness in the fingers when the wrist is tapped at the palm side of the hand (this alone is insufficient for a CTS diagnosis, as it is also a possible symptom of many other conditions)
A positive Phalen’s maneuver: Pain, numbness or tingling in the wrist and fingers when the wrist is flexed to the hand’s maximum abilityFurther testing is usually needed, even if all of these symptoms are present, in order to confirm a diagnosis of CTS. This may involve:Nerve conduction test: Damaged nerves cannot transmit signals to the body parts in order to bring about certain actions as quickly as healthy nerves can. Nerve damage is a common result of CTS. To detect it, the doctor will attach electrodes to the hand and wrist to stimulate the nerves in the fingers and wrist with an electric current. The speed with which the signal can travel through the nerves will be indicative of the extent of any nerve damage, and can support or discredit a diagnosis of CTS. This test usually takes around 10 minutes to perform, and can be moderately uncomfortable because it produces an unfamiliar tapping/tingling sensation.
Imaging study: Doctors may perform an ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in order to visualize the median nerve and carpal tunnel and determine their exact positions and the extent of the nerve entrapment.
Blood testing: To rule out other conditions which also have symptoms of pain, numbness and tingling in the hand/wrist, including diabetes, diseases of the thyroid and arthritis, doctors may perform a blood test.Other conditions which may be misdiagnosed as CTSCarpal tunnel syndrome is frequently misdiagnosed due to the fact that it shares symptoms with several other conditions, including arthritis, wrist tendonitis, repetitive strain injury (RSI) and thoracic outlet syndrome. Symptoms which CTS shares with other conditions include:Tingling
Pain
Numbness
Hot-and-cold sensations
Difficulty grasping or using one’s handIt is important to be aware of the key differences between CTS and some other conditions which share its symptoms, in order to avoid a misdiagnosis. Other conditions which are commonly misdiagnosed as CTS include:Arthritis: Arthritis can affect all the fingers in the hand, whereas CTS cannot affect the little (pinky) finger. Whereas CTS is worse at night, arthritis is not affected by the time of day. The symptoms of CTS can be absent and then suddenly become triggered by a particular activity, whereas the pain associated with arthritis is usually constantly present but alters in intensity during activities which put strain on the hands and wrists.[16]
Nerve compression due to conditions affecting the spine: Conditions such as spinal disc herniation (a slipped disc) and cervical stenosis (a condition characterised by weakness and numbness that may affect areas including the spine, neck, shoulders, hands, arms and legs) can cause nerve compression that may result in similar sensations to those of CTS.
Wrist tendonitis: In wrist tendonitis, the area affected by symptoms may be different to that of CTS. The pain, numbness and tingling may affect the tendons in any part of the hand or wrist, whereas in CTS the symptoms are limited to the thumb, index and middle fingers, the palm side of the wrist and the radial half of the ring finger.
Thoracic outlet syndrome: In thoracic outlet syndrome, blood vessels or nerves in the space between the collarbone and the first rib become compressed. The pain can affect the shoulders and neck, as well as the fingers. The fingers which are usually affected are the little (pinky) finger and the non-radial half of the ring finger. These are the two areas that cannot be affected by the symptoms of CTS.[17]
Repetitive strain injury (RSI): This is a general term to describe symptoms including pain, throbbing and stiffness in the muscles and tendons as a result of overuse and repetitive movements.[18] RSI can occur anywhere in the body, but most often affects the neck, shoulders, forearms, elbows, hands and wrists. When it occurs in the hand and wrists, RSI may be mistaken for CTS, but unlike CTS, RSI is capable of affecting any part of the overall area.","Carpal tunnel syndrome may disappear on its own without treatment. If CTS is caused by another condition such as arthritis or an underactive thyroid, its symptoms may alleviate on their own when the causal condition is treated.If one’s carpal tunnel syndrome is not caused by another treatable medical condition, it is best to begin treatment as soon as possible to prevent the symptoms worsening and to reduce the level of damage to the median nerve associated with continuous pressure.For those with mild symptoms, and/or who have been affected for a short time, non-surgical treatments such as wrist splinting and medications may be sufficient. In more severe cases, or where the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome cannot be alleviated by non-surgical means, surgery to relieve pressure on the median nerve may be recommended.In pregnant women, the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome often abate in the weeks after the pregnancy ends, with no need for treatment. Those who are still experiencing symptoms of CTS three months after the conclusion of the pregnancy should seek medical attention to devise a treatment plan.[19]Wrist splintingWrist splinting is a common first-line treatment for mild to moderate CTS. It involves wearing a splint at night for a few weeks in order to hold the joint in a neutral position. This helps to prevent the symptoms of CTS from developing overnight, when the pain is usually worse.Wrist splints come in many different shapes and sizes and a doctor can recommend a suitable one. A wrist splint works by preventing the hand from bending in way which brings on the symptoms of CTS during the night. However, because the wrist is kept in a fixed position by the splint, it is important to exercise the hand and wrist during the day to prevent the muscles from weakening due to underuse.The effects of wrist splinting usually become noticeable after a few weeks of wearing the splint. In some cases, this is a sufficient treatment for CTS and symptoms will disappear.However, for many people, splinting is a temporary solution rather than an effective treatment for CTS, and symptoms may return. In this case, other treatment options such as medications or surgery may be recommended.[20]Medications for CTSMedications that are prescribed in the management of CTS can provide temporary relief from the pain and inflammation associated with the condition. The medications most commonly prescribed for CTS are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and, in more severe cases of CTS, corticosteroids, which are taken as tablets or injected into the carpal tunnel.NSAIDs are available as over-the-counter or prescription medication, and can temporarily minimize joint and muscle pain. Naproxen and ibuprofen are the NSAIDs most commonly used for pain management in CTS. Long-term use of NSAIDs carries multiple health risks, including impaired gastroenteric function and increased likelihood of peptic ulcer disease. NSAIDs should be taken for a limited period of time only, in consultation with a medical professional.
Corticosteroids can be taken orally as tablets or injected into the carpal tunnel. Local injections are considered to be more effective than oral corticosteroids at reducing the pain and inflammation associated with CTS. Corticosteroids may be prescribed in cases of severe CTS, and/or when wrist splinting has not provided long-term relief.[21]Short-term use of corticosteroids (for example, for a few weeks or a month) is associated with a variety of side effects, including stomach problems, skin problems and weight gain, which may render them an unsuitable treatment option for some people. Continuous (longer-term) use of corticosteroids is never recommended for the treatment of CTS as it is associated with increased risk of the development or worsening of a variety of health conditions such as diabetes and osteoporosis.Medications help manage the painful symptoms of CTS, rather than treating the cause. Neither NSAIDs nor corticosteroids can relieve the pressure on the median nerve and these medications can therefore only provide temporary relief from the symptoms of CTS. Medications should be used as part of a wider treatment strategy which focuses on releasing the entrapped median nerve.SurgerySurgery for CTS will not usually be considered as a first-line treatment, and is usually recommended only when CTS is at a late stage and/or has not been alleviated by non-surgical treatments. Urgent surgery for CTS is usually only needed as a treatment for acute CTS.Surgery for CTS involves cutting a part of the carpal tunnel in order to reduce pressure on the median nerve. The part of the carpal tunnel which is cut during surgery is known as the flexor retinaculum. There are two possible surgical procedures for CTS: endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release.[22]Both types of surgery can be performed as an outpatient procedure and usually only require a local anesthetic to numb the hand or arm.Endoscopic carpal tunnel release: A small incision is made in the palm and/or the wrist, and a small camera called an endoscope is inserted into one of the incisions to monitor the procedure. The flexor retinaculum is then cut with an instrument inserted into the second incision. It is also possible to perform the procedure by making only one incision in the wrist, and inserting both the surgical instrument and the endoscope into the same incision.
Open carpal tunnel release: The surgeon will make a cut on the inside of the wrist to reveal the carpal tunnel, and will cut through the flexor retinaculum.The recovery time may be slightly shorter for an endoscopic procedure, but most people can return to work less than three weeks after either procedure.[23]Self-care for managing CTSIf a person is diagnosed with CTS, they can help to prevent the condition getting worse by making certain adaptations to their lifestyle. The two principal lifestyle changes which are recommended for people who have been diagnosed with CTS are:Exercising the hands and wrists: There are many possible hand exercises that can be incorporated into a person’s daily routine in order to ease the pain associated with CTS and prevent future injuries.[24] When a person is diagnosed with CTS, doctors will be able to recommend and demonstrate exercises, and provide guidelines on how often these should be carried out.
Avoiding strain: CTS can be aggravated by overuse of the hands and wrists, in particular through repetitive activities such as working in an assembly line or using vibrating tools. People with CTS whose work involves activities that may increase their symptoms are often advised to stay home when they are undergoing treatment to ensure its effectiveness. Wearing a wrist splint at night can also help to reduce strain.[20]","It is not always possible to prevent CTS, particularly if it is caused by pregnancy or another health condition. However, there are some lifestyle changes that people can make to reduce the likelihood of developing CTS. These preventative measures are particularly recommended for people whose daily activities are associated with a higher risk of CTS.Preventative measures against developing CTS include:Ensuring that any other health conditions a person may have that could contribute to developing CTS (such as diabetes) are treated or managed effectively
Maintaining a healthy weight, diet and exercise regime
Avoiding the use of tobacco products, which weaken the immune system and increases the likelihood of developing inflammatory conditions that can cause CTS
Regularly assessing one’s day-to-day routine in order to minimize activities involving repetitive or intense movements that might contribute to an increased risk of CTS
Following ergonomic guidelines (recommendations on how to position and use equipment for efficiency and comfort) at home and at work, in order to ensure that all activities are carried out in the most comfortable, appropriate way for the body
Taking regular breaks from any activities that contribute to CTS, especially when using vibrating tools, in order to reduce the impact of activities which put pressure on the wrists and hands","Q: Does typing cause CTS?
A: Typing is associated with an increased likelihood of developing repetitive strain injury (RSI). If RSI affects the tendons or ligaments in the carpal tunnel, this can cause compression on the median nerve and the development of CTS. However, research has shown that there is at most a very small direct link between computer work and CTS. Activities which involve using the hands and wrists with a greater intensity, such as using vibrating tools, are significantly more likely to cause CTS than typing. The use of ergonomic computer keyboards is, however, sometimes recommended as a preventative measure against developing CTS.[20]Q: Can children be affected by CTS?
A: CTS in children is rare. When it develops, it is most commonly related to having a genetically inherited condition associated with inflammation, such as lysosomal storage disease, which can cause swelling in the joints and pressure to build up in the carpal tunnel. The symptoms of CTS and its treatment options are the same for children as for adults.[25]"
Cataracts,https://ada.com/conditions/cataracts/,,"Cataracts typically develop slowly, meaning the symptoms may be difficult to detect or confused with normal signs of aging. The symptoms include:Blurred, clouded or dimmed vision
Sensitivity to light and glare, particularly at night
Objects appear yellow-tinged or faded in color
Halos appearing around lights
Changes in glasses prescriptionOccasionally, when cataracts first develop, it can lead to an improvement in nearsightedness. This phenomenon is known as “second sight” and is a temporary occurrence that will disappear as the condition develops.[5]","The lens of the eye filters light onto the retina, allowing for clear and focussed vision. Largely, it is made from water and proteins. Cataracts are brought about when these proteins begin to clump in the lens, leading to blurred, faded and cloudy vision which can worsen over time. This clumping is commonly a result of aging, yet it is not clear why some people and not others are affected.There are, however, some factors that may increase an individual’s chances of developing cataracts, including:[6]Exposure to ultraviolet radiation, from sunlight or radiation therapy
Diabetes
Eye conditions like uveitis and glaucoma
Eye injury or surgery
Use of corticosteroids
A family history of cataractsOther factors that are also thought to be linked to the development of cataracts include:Smoking
Alcohol
The abuse of illicit substances
Vitamin deficiency. See these resources on vitamin D deficiency, vitamin K deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency for more information.","Cataracts are diagnosed through a full eye examination carried out by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Those experiencing problems with their sight should visit an eye care professional as soon as possible. Moreover, people over 40 should undergo an eye test at least once every two years.[7]","If the symptoms of cataracts are mild, an altered prescription, i.e. for different glasses or contact lenses, may be effective in correcting an individual’s vision. However, it is typical for cataracts to worsen over time. If this happens, it is likely that surgery will be necessary.[8]Cataracts surgery is a common procedure and usually carried out under local anaesthetic. Most people who undergo cataract surgery will see a significant improvement in their vision, with 9 out of 10 people achieving between 20/20 and 20/40 vision afterwards. However, most surgeons will focus on correcting long-distance sight, meaning glasses may still be needed to see things close at hand.Good to know: The terms 20/20 and 20/40 are visual acuity measurements.This is usually measured using the Snellen visual acuity system:The top number of the fraction refers to the viewing distance between the patient and the eye chart.
The bottom number of the fraction refers to the distance at which a person with ideal vision would be able to see the figures on the eye chart clearly.A person with 20/40 vision can therefore see figures on the eye chart clearly at a distance of 20 feet, whereas a person with ideal vision could see the same figures clearly, from a distance of 40 feet away from the eye chart.In the United States, the distance at which visual acuity is measured, is typically 20 feet. In other countries, this distance is generally six meters, and a person’s visual acuity may therefore be expressed as a fraction of six.RisksThe risk of complications during and after cataract surgery is small. The most common complication is posterior capsule opacification (PCO) brought about when skin or membrane grows over the implanted lens, resulting in a return of clouded or impaired vision. PCO can be corrected with laser surgery.[8]There are other risks that are far less common. Risks during the operation include:Tearing of the lens
Inability to remove the cataracts
Bleeding of the eye
Accidental damage to other areas of the eyeRisks following the operation include:Inflammation of the eye
Retina swelling
Cornea swelling
Retinal detachment
InfectionIf complications become apparent after surgery, a doctor should be contacted as soon as possible. In most cases, complications can be rectified with treatment or further surgery.","Although there is no guaranteed way to prevent cataracts, there are some preventative measures that can be undertaken to reduce the risk. They include:[9]Having your eyes checked regularly
Eating a healthy diet rich in vitamins
Quitting or cutting down on smoking
Reducing your alcohol intake
Avoiding prolonged use of corticosteroids","Q: Is cataract extraction possible?
A: Yes, cataract extraction is carried out through surgery. The procedure is considered routine and is a success in most cases, leading to between 20/20 and 20/40 vision.[10]Q: Do cataracts lead to blindness?
A: Cataracts cannot be reversed but it can be treated effectively through surgery. If, however, the condition is left untreated, it can lead to blindness."
Causes of Miscarriage,https://ada.com/causes-of-miscarriage/,,[],[],"A 2015 survey across the U.S. of people who have experienced a miscarriage, found that over 75 percent of people strongly wish to know the cause of their miscarriage.[29] To help identify any possible causes for a miscarriage, it is usual for doctors to perform:[30]An autopsy on the pregnancy tissue: This is usually carried out by performing a whole-body radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a full-body examination and DNA tests to detect the presence of infectious agents and pathogens.
A placental exam: Laboratory analysis of the placenta, which may detect the presence of causal agents of miscarriage, such as infectious bacteria.
Fertility testing: After three consecutive miscarriages (recurrent miscarriage), one or both partners will be offered fertility tests in order to discern whether fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or fertility medications, may be necessary in order to increase the chances of a future healthy pregnancy.Good to know: Fertility testing is not usually carried out except in cases of recurrent miscarriage, because it is very common to go on to have a healthy pregnancy in future after one, or even two miscarriages.","A miscarriage may be caused by one or more changeable or unchangeable factors. It may be possible to find out the causes of a miscarriage by performing an autopsy on the pregnancy tissue and/or a placental exam (an analysis of the placenta). However, it is not always possible to discern the cause(s) of a miscarriage. This is not necessarily bad news: many people whose causal factors for a miscarriage are unknown go on to have a healthy pregnancy resulting in a live birth in future.Unchangeable factorsIf the miscarriage is caused by unchangeable factors such as a person’s age or an underlying health condition which is already being managed effectively to ensure the best chance of a healthy pregnancy, it may not be possible to take preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of miscarrying in future.Changeable factorsIf the miscarriage is caused by changeable factors such as eating an unsuitable pregnancy diet, taking medications which are unsuitable for use in pregnancy, or a treatable, underlying condition, doctors can provide guidance on treating and managing these problems and help devise the best healthcare plan to follow before trying to conceive again.",[],"Q: What is male-factor miscarriage?
A: Male-factor miscarriage is more common in pregnancies where the male partner is over 40. It is a term used to describe miscarriage that is due to depleted sperm health. Semen analysis can be performed to determine the possible causes.[31] Causes of male-factor miscarriage may include:Abnormal sperm shape (morphology)
Defective or fragmented DNA. Although conception may be possible, defected of fragmented DNA can lead to chromosomal abnormalities of the fetus, which may ultimately result in miscarriage.Q: What are the most common misconceptions about the causes of miscarriage?
A: There are many factors which are reputed to cause miscarriage, but which are not scientifically linked to it. These factors do not, therefore, need to be avoided with the aim of miscarriage prevention. They include:[2]Eating spicy food
Airplane travel; always discuss air travel plans with a doctor in advance, as the risks posed can depend on the month of pregnancy
Sexual intercourse
Low mood
Exercise and heavy lifting, although consulting a doctor is advised to make sure that your exercise plan is suitable for pregnancyQ: How can I tell if I am having a miscarriage?
A: The most common signs of miscarriage are vaginal bleeding, cramping, and sudden loss of pregnancy symptoms. However, these symptoms can all occur as natural features of a healthy pregnancy, and are not always a cause for concern. Seek immediate medical attention if a miscarriage is suspected; doctors will be able to establish whether there is a pregnancy complication, such as miscarriage or will be able to reassure you that the pregnancy is progressing normally.

Cervical Cancer,https://ada.com/conditions/cervical-cancer/,,"Symptoms include vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding in between menstruation or after sex, pain during sex and pain in the lower part of the belly. Many women with cervical cancer have no symptoms, so screening (testing for the condition in people with no symptoms) is important.",[],"The diagnosis may be based on screening for changes in cervical cells. Women are regularly screened (tested without symptoms) for cervical cancer, and the most common test for screening is a Pap smear. This test involves sampling cells from the cervix and looking at them under a microscope. If there are signs that a cancer could be developing, a biopsy (a bigger sample of the cervix) may be needed to identify the type of cancer.","If there are cells on the cervix that have a high chance of becoming a cancer over time, these are removed with a procedure called a large loop excision (of the) transformation zone (a LLETZ procedure). Treatment of cervical cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, cervical cancer can be treated by radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy or a combination of therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment.","Vaccination against the wart virus helps to prevent most cases of cervical cancer. This is currently given to girls between the ages of 9 and 14 as a part of national immunization programs. Screening (Pap tests) for cervical cancer is also very important because it allows cervical cancer to be detected and treated at an early stage. Using a condom during sexual intercourse helps to avoid the major cause of cervical cancer, the human papilloma virus (HPV or wart virus).",[]

People with PID may experience symptoms such as abdominal pain and fever.","Cervicitis is most commonly caused by infection. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are the most common type of infection that cause the condition. STIs that may cause cervicitis include:[1]Chlamydia
Gonorrhea
Genital herpes
TrichomoniasisLess commonly, cervicitis may be caused by factors such as:An allergy to the chemicals found in condoms, spermicides or douches
Injury or irritation caused by things such as diaphragms, tampons or pessaries

A hormonal imbalance
Cancer or cancer treatment","Women displaying the symptoms of cervicitis should see a doctor for diagnosis. Doctors will be able to identify the condition, as well as any other conditions that involve similar symptoms.Diagnosing cervicitis will usually involve tests including:[3]A speculum exam, where a device called a speculum is inserted into the vagina. The speculum is gently opened to widen the vagina so that the vagina and cervix can be seen. The doctor will be looking for signs of redness, discharge and inflammation of the vaginal walls.
A pap smear, also known as a pap test, which involves swabbing cells from the vagina and cervix and testing these cells for abnormalities. This can be performed during the speculum exam.
A bimanual pelvic exam, which involves the doctor inserting a gloved finger into the vagina to palpate for abnormalities.
Tests for STIs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea and herpes.","There is no specific treatment for cervicitis. Instead, a doctor will recommend a treatment method based on the root cause of the condition, as well as the individual’s symptoms, age, overall health and medical history.In cases where cervicitis is caused by an infection, antibiotics will generally be prescribed. If the condition is a result of irritation from condoms or tampons, for example, treatment may involve ceasing to use these products to allow for healing.","Using condoms during sexual intercourse can help prevent bacterial and viral infections of the cervix.

Chest Cold,https://ada.com/conditions/chest-cold/,,"The main symptom of a chest cold is a cough, which will often be persistent and accompanied by the coughing up of mucus. The production of excess mucus is normal during a chest cold – a response designed to protect the respiratory tract from germs and bacteria. Other symptoms may include:[3]Fever
Headache
Aches and pains
Other symptoms associated with a cold or fluThe cough associated with a chest cold will typically take two to three weeks to disappear completely. If you are experiencing any symptoms of a chest cold and want to find out what the problem is, the Ada app can help. Download it for free now or find out more here.","A chest cold can be either a viral or bacterial infection, though it is far more common to contract the condition virally. The viruses that cause the condition are of the same variety as those that cause the common cold or flu, and it usually develops from these conditions. If a cold or flu seems to worsen, therefore, it may be that a chest cold has developed.The viruses that cause a chest cold are most commonly passed on through tiny droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. The virus can survive on a surface such as a countertop or door-handle, for example, for up to 24 hours.[4] To help avoid infection, individuals should take measures such as washing their hands thoroughly and avoiding sharing drinking glasses and utensils.","Doctors will usually be able to diagnose a chest cold by asking some questions about a person’s symptoms and by performing a physical examination.[5] In some cases, a doctor may order further tests to diagnose the condition or distinguish it from other conditions. These tests include:[6]Pulmonary function test: Used to check for signs of asthma or emphysema.
Sputum tests: Used to identify the bacteria within sputum (mucus).
X-ray: Potentially useful in identifying the source of an individual’s symptoms.","A chest cold does not require treatment in all cases – it will normally begin to fade in two to three weeks, though the cough may persist for longer.If the coughing is particularly severe, cough medication is available over the counter, or it may be prescribed by a doctor. Pain relievers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol can be taken to suppress pain. For those with allergies, asthma or chronic obtrusive pulmonary disease, a range of medications can be prescribed as needed.[7]As a chest cold is in most cases caused by a virus, antibiotics are useless and may even be harmful. However, if it is thought that a chest cold is bacterial in origin, antibiotics can be used to effectively treat the condition.","The viruses that in most cases cause a chest cold can be hard to avoid, spread as they are by tiny, often undetectable droplets released into the air or onto surfaces. However, certain measures can be taken to try and avoid these viruses. They include:[9]Washing hands frequently and thoroughly
Getting plenty of rest
Avoiding excessive touching of the eyes or mouth
Avoiding sharing things such as drinking glasses or utensils
Staying healthy with regular exercise, enough fluids and a balanced diet
Getting vaccines for pneumonia, flu and whooping cough","Q: What is the duration of a chest cold?
A: Typically, a chest cold will develop three or four days after a cold or the flu and lasts for around two to three weeks. However, this is approximate and symptoms may last for longer. If this is the case, medical attention should be sought.Q: I am pregnant. Should I be worried about a chest cold?
A: Special care should be taken by pregnant women to avoid a chest cold. However, if the condition does develop, women should be sure to consult a doctor who should be able to advise on an appropriate treatment method, if one is needed at all, including identifying medications that are safe to take during pregnancy.[11]Unfortunately, when pregnant, a chest cold is more likely to develop into a more serious respiratory condition like pneumonia. Seek urgent medical attention if the following symptoms develop:Chest pain
Blood in the mucus
High fever
Unrelenting shortness of breathQ: Is a chest cold contagious?
A: Yes, the viruses that typically cause chest colds, are contagious. Avoid contact with infected individuals, wash your hands regularly and avoid sharing utensils and glasses to lessen the chances of picking up the condition.Q: Are chest colds viral or bacterial?
A: In approximately 85 to 95 percent of cases, acute bronchitis is caused by a virus.[12] The viruses are the same as those that cause the common cold and flu. People with underlying health conditions, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, are more likely than otherwise healthy people to experience bacterial acute bronchitis.Q: Can a chest cold turn into pneumonia?
A: Pneumonia can result from a chest cold as a secondary complication. Older people are especially susceptible to this. Symptoms of pneumonia include fever, an increased heart rate, chest pain and shortness of breath.[1]"
Childhood Absence Epilepsy,https://ada.com/conditions/childhood-absence-epilepsy/,,"The symptoms of an absence seizure are short episodes of staring or unawareness which occur several times a day. This may occur mid-sentence, or appear as if the child is daydreaming. During these episodes, there may be other signs such as lip smacking, chewing movements, sighing, eyelid fluttering or small jerks of the head. After the episode, the child has no memory of this period. Some children are first diagnosed when their seizures cause difficulties at school.",[],"The diagnosis is made by an experienced doctor or pediatrician based on the symptoms and a description of the seizure. A test called a video-EEG (video- electroencephalography) is often conducted, which involves a test for electrical signs of seizure in the brain (electroencephalography) while the child is videoed in order to observe the seizure characteristics.","Absence seizures can usually be well controlled with epilepsy medications. No special treatment is needed during an absence seizure, though it can be helpful to gently touch the child to check if they are having a seizure or daydreaming.",[],[]
Childhood Asthma,https://ada.com/conditions/childhood-asthma/,,"Children are affected by asthma more commonly than adults. Asthma in children usually starts to develop in early childhood. Asthmatic children often present symptoms at under five years of age. Despite the presence of asthma-like symptoms, it can be difficult to diagnose asthma in infants and young children, as their lungs may not be developed sufficiently to carry out certain tests.One of the first signs that a child might be affected by asthma is an involuntary whistling sound which accompanies their breathing. This is commonly known as “wheezing.” Typically, wheezing is especially prominent when the child exhales.Other possible signs and symptoms of childhood-onset asthma include:Chest pain
Chest tightness
Depleted stamina after play or exercise
Diminished energy throughout the day
Difficulty drawing breath
Recurrent coughing, typically at night
Retractions (involuntary pulling in of the chest which occurs as a result of laboured breathing)
Shortness of breath","It is not always possible to identify the cause of asthma in children, and a child may develop the condition with no apparent triggers. The main possible causes of asthma in children are:Genetic predisposition: Children with a family history of asthma, eczema, hives and/or allergic rhinitis develop asthma more commonly than those without.
Environmental factors: Exposure to air pollutants, including cigarette smoke and potential triggers of asthma, including dust mites, pollen and pet dander, may cause children to develop  asthma.
Infections: Children may develop asthma as a result of certain types of infections that affect the airways, including viral infections such as the common cold.","Each child experiences asthma differently, and a child may not exhibit all of the symptoms or respond to all the triggers listed. Within individual children, asthma symptoms and their severity may change. It is usual for the doctor to consider a range of possible causes for the child’s symptoms, in order to eliminate other conditions before offering a definitive diagnosis of asthma.Non-allergic conditions that typically cause asthma-like symptoms include:Aspiration (when pieces of food or other small items accidentally pass into the airway)
Pulmonary Aspergillosis (a fungal infection of the lung)
Respiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
Rhinitis (runny, stuffy nose)
Sinusitis
Vocal cord dysfunction
Acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
Airway abnormalities caused by such as an esophageal disorder (where acid from the stomach triggers a reaction that inflames the airways) or neuromuscular respiratory diseasesMany of these conditions commonly co-occur with asthma. A diagnosis of asthma in a child therefore requires the doctor to determine whether the child’s symptoms are purely asthmatic, caused by a condition other than asthma, or whether the child has developed another condition in addition to asthma.Diagnostic testsA variety of tests are available to help diagnose asthma in children, including lung function tests and allergy skin tests. These tests usually work best for children of five years and older.Diagnosing asthma in children of 5 years and olderTo diagnose asthma in children of 5 years and older, doctors tend to use the same tests that are used to identify the disease in adults. The main tests used to identify asthma are:Lung function tests: Lung function tests (spirometry) are primary tests used to measure how much air the child can exhale and how quickly. They involve using a device called a spirometer, attached to a mouthpiece by a cable. [4] To determine the severity of the asthma diagnosis, the child’s lung function is usually measured during three levels of activity: after taking asthma medication, after exercising and at rest. Lung function tests employ flow volume loops to measure how quickly the child can inhale, and their maximum intake of breath in one inhalation. This helps detect obstruction of air in the neck, such as vocal cord paralysis or dysfunction- which helps to identify any non-asthmatic conditions that may be a correct or additional diagnosis.
Allergy skin tests: When a child is diagnosed with asthma, and  the doctor suspects that they may be affected by allergic asthma, allergy skin tests may be used in addition to the tests for asthma to test for possible triggers which may be causing the symptoms. The skin is pricked, and solutions containing extracts of common allergy-causing substances are applied, such as animal dander, mold or dust mites. The child is then observed for signs of an allergic reaction.
Methacholine challenge test (MCT): The Methacholine challenge test (MCT) is used to diagnose mild or intermittent (occurring at irregular intervals) asthma. If lung function tests do not result in the child’s asthma diagnosis, a doctor may order a methacholine challenge test. During this test, the child inhales increasing amounts of a mist of methacholine before and after spirometry. Methacholine is a drug that stimulates the nervous system and causes wheezing and shortness of breath.
Body plethysmography: In some cases, a body plethysmography test may be carried out in addition to the diagnostic tests above. In this test, a child will breathe in and out in an instrument called a body box. The body box is airtight, and breathing in and out of it causes changes to the air pressure inside the box.Medical professionals can monitor the air pressure inside the box to add many details to their understanding of how well a child’s respiratory system is performing. This test can be used to measure factors including the volume of air present in the lungs after breathing normally, the specific airway resistance (how much the respiratory tract resists airflow when a person breathes in and out) of the lungs and their total lung capacity.[5]Diagnosing asthma in children under 5 years of ageIt is often very hard for doctors to provide a conclusive diagnosis of asthma in children under 5 years of age, as their lungs are not sufficiently developed to accurately carry out lung function tests. Many other conditions such as rhinitis, sinusitis, and respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis, have the same symptoms as asthma. For this reason, doctors often opt to observe a child’s symptoms over a longer period with regular check-ups, until it is possible to provide an asthma diagnosis.","There is no cure for asthma, but asthma can be managed with proper prevention and treatment. Treatment for childhood asthma focuses on minimising exposure to any identified triggers, so as to avoid flare-ups. With the right treatment options identified, it should be possible for a child to pursue their activities, including sports and exercise, as normal.As children learn to avoid asthma triggers, it is possible for them to manage their symptoms so effectively that they appear to “outgrow” their asthma. More than three-quarters of children who develop asthma symptoms before age 7 no longer exhibit perceptible symptoms by age 16.However, there is always the possibility of further flare-ups, and asthma, which has been successfully managed for long periods, can resurface later in childhood, or in adulthood. Types of medication for childhood asthma include long-term medications, courses of immunology and quick-relief medications to unblock the airways during an asthmatic flare-up.Medications for treating asthma in childrenA range of different medications are available, depending on the severity of a child’s asthma. When a child’s symptoms respond well to treatment and the asthma is eventually running a lighter course over time, doctors may suggest switching to milder medications.Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)These medications  are considered to be the most effective medications for controlling asthma when taken regularly. They work on a continuous basis to reduce swelling of the airways. The most commonly prescribed ICSs include fluticasone (Flovent Diskus, Flovent HFA), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), mometasone (Asmanex), ciclesonide (Alvesco) and beclomethasone (Qvar). These medications need to be taken regularly for several days to weeks, adhering to the prescription, before the child feels their full anti-asthmatic effects.Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)These medications are nebulized medications which provide immediate relief of asthma symptoms. They work by relaxing the inflamed airways, making breathing easier. SABA medications, for example,  include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA) and levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA).Long-acting beta-agonistsThese medications work by relaxing the muscles surrounding the bronchial tubes, which causes a widening of the airways. It is recommended that the long-acting beta agonists be used in combination with an anti-inflammatory medication, such as the inhaled corticosteroids.The most commonly prescribed LABA medications in the U.S. are salmeterol (Serevent), formoterol (Foradil) and a formoterol solution for nebulizers called Perforomist.Combination nebulizersThese medications contain both a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) and a corticosteroid. These drugs have very different ways of influencing the airways and have been found to offer a child the most benefit when they are combined. This allows a child to profit from both of their mechanisms of action at the same time and makes combination nebulizers an effective treatment option for childhood asthma (as well as adult asthma) in many cases. Commonly prescribed combination nebulizers include combinations of fluticasone plus salmeterol (Advair), mometasone plus formoterol (Dulera) and budesonide plus formoterol (Symbicort).Leukotriene modifiersThese medications are oral medications that can reduce asthma symptoms for up to 24 hours. They include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo). Care should be taken when taking leukotriene modifiers as they have been, in rare cases, linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Medical advice should be sought immediately if the child has any unusual reaction.Anticholinergic agentsThese medications are another treatment option for severe asthma. They work by widening the airways to allow for easier breathing. The most commonly prescribed anticholinergic medication is tiotropium (Spiriva).Immunomodulatory agentsThese medications can be used to treat very severe cases of asthma in children, where symptoms persist despite the use of SABA, LABA and corticosteroid medications. This treatment involves introducing antibodies (biological agents which interact with the bodies cells to fight and interrupt the usual progression of an asthma attack) into the body.The antibodies which are used to treat asthma in children are Anti-IgE (omalizumab) and anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab). Both of these medications have been found effective for treating asthma in children. In particular, in reducing exacerbation rate (the medical term for the condition becoming worse, or more symptoms developing, which can happen in a flare-up or an asthma attack). Their other benefits include helping bring a child’s asthmatic symptoms under control and improving their quality of life.Mepolizumab (Nucala) may be appropriate for children with eosinophilic asthma, a subtype of asthma which is often severe, in which the whole respiratory tract becomes involved in obstructing the airways. mepolizumab works by reducing the number of eosinophils in the blood (the white blood cells that in large numbers interact with other factors in the blood and cause the airways to become inflamed), and thereby reduces the likelihood of an asthma attack for children with this type of asthma.Omalizumab (Xolair) is used to treat children affected specifically by allergic asthma. It works by targeting immunoglobulin E, the substance produced by the body that causes inflammation of the airways in children with allergic asthma. This medication reduces the immune system's reaction to allergy-inducing substances, such as pollen, dust mites and pet dander, and calms inflammation. It is usually delivered by injection every two to four weeks.Omalizumab is the only medication for asthma which must be administered by injection only. If it is recommended for treating a child, they will need to visit their healthcare provider to have the medication administered.GINA guidelinesThe Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) provides a five-stage treatment plan which is very helpful in devising the right treatment plan to suit the individual asthmatic child. The GINA guidelines arrange a series of asthma treatment options as a sequence,Following the GINA guidelines, a doctor will prescribe a treatment plan and assess its efficacy during regular check-ups. They will adjust the plan accordingly, continually measuring the child’s response to their treatment and refining the plan as needed, until the symptoms of asthma improve.The guidelines recommend a five-step plan for the ongoing treatment of asthma, according to the severity of the child’s condition. Children with mild asthma will be treated according to the guidelines outlined in Step 1 (see below) and children with more severe symptoms will begin treatment according to the guidelines outlined in Step 2, 3, 4 or 5, depending on the severity of their asthma at the time of starting treatment. A step down to a milder treatment option can be considered during a monthly check-up, if the doctor considers the child’s symptoms to have improved sufficiently.The GINA approach to controlling asthma symptoms aimed at reducing risk and improving asthma management includes the following steps:Step 1: The doctor will consider prescribing a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and will prescribe a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for relief as needed. Acting within minutes, and lasting several hours, short acting beta agonists are nebulized medications which can quickly relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. ICSs work by  relieving airway inflammation caused by asthma.Good to know: Long-term corticosteroid use is generally associated with severe side-effects, but the inhalatory steroids used in ICSs do not carry the same risks. When an ICS is administered correctly, the corticosteroid medication goes straight to a child’s airways and very little is absorbed into the rest of their body. ICSs are therefore safe for use on a long-term basis and tend to show their best effects after around three months of use.[6]Step 2: The doctor will definitely prescribe a low-dose ICS, as is considered for children at Step 1, as well as prescribing a SABA for relief as needed.Step 3: A low-dose ICS or a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) will be prescribed and a SABA or ICS for relief as needed.  In some situations, long-acting beta agonists have been linked to severe asthma attacks if they are taken only by themselves without an ICS. For this reason, LABA medications should always be given to a child with a nebulizer that also contains a corticosteroid (ICS). These combination nebulizers should be used only for asthma that's not well-controlled by other medications.Step 4: A medium to high ICS/LABA will be prescribed and additionally SABA or another low dose ICS for relief as needed.Step 5: The doctor will refer the child for an add-on treatment for severe asthma, such as anticholinergic agents or immunomodulatory agents. They will also prescribe a SABA or ICS for relief as needed.Children with asthma may also be referred to an allergist who will be able to advise on specialised treatment, if their asthma is allergy-induced.Additional treatments for allergic asthmaDesensitization or hyposensitization (immunotherapy): Allergen-containing injections or oral medication gradually reduce any reaction of the child’s immune system to specific allergens over a period of months or years. The length of the course and intervals between injections vary according to the individual’s symptoms.
Oral and nasal medications: The child may be prescribed antihistamines and decongestants in pill form, as well as, or as an alternative to corticosteroid, cromolyn (a drug that prevents the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells) and ipratropium nasal sprays.",[],"Q: Does childhood asthma damage the lungs?
A: It is important to diagnose and begin treating asthma in children promptly, in order to prevent it causing long-term damage to the lungs. Chronic (long-term) asthma, or asthma which is not treated effectively over the course of many years, has the potential to damage the lungs on a permanent basis in two main ways: by causing airway fibrosis (scarring) of the tissue in the airways and by causing remodelling (permanent narrowing of the airways).[7]Both of these changes result from the respiratory system being inflamed regularly for long periods. Not everybody has the potential to develop permanent lung damage from the inflammation associated with asthma, but it is important that all children with asthma begin effective treatment as soon as possible to avoid this outcome. The Asthma Center recommends that early and intensive treatment of childhood asthma should be focussed particularly on calming inflammation in order to reduce the risk of long-term lung damage.Q: Can childhood asthma cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?
A: Not usually, especially if asthma in children is treated promptly and effectively. The primary causes of COPD – a type of obstructive lung disease associated with long term breathing problems and poor air flow which usually develops in adulthood – are smoking tobacco and exposure to poor quality air, for example, living in an area with high pollution.However, COPD can also be caused by genetic factors and people, who are affected by asthma or who have been affected as children, are believed to be at greater risk than the general population of developing the condition.[8] Recent research indicates that persistent (long term, severe or ineffectively treated) childhood asthma can lead to reduced lung growth and function in adulthood, an outcome which is found to increase the possibility of developing COPD.[9]Q: Can childhood asthma come back during pregnancy?
A: Many children appear to “outgrow” childhood asthma. However, there is no cure for asthma and there is always the possibility that a child may encounter new triggers and re-experience the symptoms as an adult. Pregnancy may place unfamiliar stresses on the body, which could trigger asthmatic symptoms.[10]"
Chiragra,https://ada.com/conditions/chiragra/,,"Typical symptoms include a severe pain in the hand and finger joints associated with redness, swelling, difficulty moving the joints and sometimes tophi (uric acid crystals deposits appearing as yellowish firm nodules). Symptoms often come on suddenly, and attacks of gout are often recurrent.",[],Diagnosis is based on the individual's medical history and physical examination. A doctor may take a sample of fluid from a swollen joint to look for evidence of gout crystals in the joint. Blood tests can monitor the amount of uric acid in the blood. Ultrasounds or X-rays of the joint may be helpful to look for signs of damage as a result of gout.,"Pain and swelling during an attack of chiragra is managed with anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving medications (such as ibuprofen, paracetamol or colchicine). Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, a healthy diet and taking regular exercise, might also be helpful in the management of gout.",Preventing future attacks of gout can be done by changing the diet to avoid foods which trigger attacks of gout and (if needed) with a medication called allopurinol. Allopurinol reduces the amount of uric acid in the blood. Losing weight might also be helpful preventing future attacks of gout.,[]
Cholecystitis,https://ada.com/conditions/cholecystitis/,,"Typical symptoms include pain in the upper or upper-right area of the belly, sweating, nausea/vomiting and symptoms that are worse when eating fatty food. Fever may suggest a bacterial infection.",[],The diagnosis is made by a doctor based on the symptoms and physical examination. Blood tests are often taken to test for signs of infection or liver problems. An ultrasound scan or a computed tomography (CT) scan may be needed to examine the gallbladder.,"Treatment of cholecystitis is usually pain relief and antibiotics. Avoiding fatty foods can help reduce the symptoms of cholecystitis. In recurrent, persistent or severe cases, surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) may be recommended. If the cause is gall stones stuck in the bile duct, a procedure called ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) may be performed.This involves an endoscopy (a long camera through the mouth to the stomach and bile duct) to remove the stones.",Reducing the amount of fatty food in the diet and losing weight gradually may also help to avoid further episodes of cholecystitis.,[]
Chronic Bronchitis,https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-bronchitis/,,"A cough and the production of mucus are the principal symptoms of chronic bronchitis. The severity of the coughing and the amount of mucus produced will differ from person to person, but these symptoms will generally persist for a minimum of three months at a time. Mucus, which is brought up when coughing, may be blood-tinged. Nasal mucus can vary in color, and can be green, yellow or clear. Often, mucus production will be at its height early in the day.[4]Other symptoms of chronic bronchitis include:Nasal congestion
Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
Wheezing
Sore throat
Fatigue
Headaches
Muscle achesThe symptoms of chronic bronchitis can on occasion become exacerbated. If this occurs, symptoms will include:Severe coughing and chest pain
Blue or grey skin discolouration, typically under the nails
High feverIf you are concerned that you may have chronic bronchitis, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.When to see a doctorTo prevent damage to the lungs, it is important to seek medical attention if chronic bronchitis is suspected. Contact a doctor if the following symptoms occur:[5]Symptoms persist for three weeks or longer
The condition is disturbing sleep
Fever is 100.4 F/38 °C or above
Mucus is discoloured
Wheezing or shortness of breath occursAlways consult a doctor if there is blood present in mucus; this can be an indication of other serious conditions, such as lung cancer.","Chronic bronchitis is caused by smoking in the majority of cases. Smoking can cause severe damage to the cilia – the tiny hairs that protect the lungs against germs and mucus – leading to repeated bouts of mucus buildup, as well as inflammation and irritation of the bronchial tubes. The longer an individual has smoked, the more severe the condition is likely to be. In some cases, chronic bronchitis can be caused by continual exposure to secondhand smoke.Less commonly, chronic bronchitis can also be triggered by the inhalation of irritants such as air pollution, chemical fumes or toxic gas. Repeated exposure to such irritants increases the chances of developing the condition. People with certain underlying conditions, e.g. asthma or cystic fibrosis, as well as those with a genetic predisposition, are more likely to develop the chronic bronchitis.[6]","In order to diagnose chronic bronchitis, a doctor will typically begin by inquiring about the symptoms an individual is experiencing and performing a full physical examination. For further confirmation, a number of tests may also be ordered. These include:[8]Pulmonary Function Test (PFT): A series of tests to measure lung volume, capacity and other functions that gives doctors a rounded picture of lung health.
Chest X-ray: Useful in diagnosing chronic bronchitis and other lung conditions.
Sputum examination: Sputum, or mucus, can be tested to determine the cause of mucus buildup.
High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT): A type of CT scan that allows doctors to image the lungs.If you are concerned that you may have chronic bronchitis, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.","There is no cure for chronic bronchitis – it can, however, have its symptoms managed effectively through a combination of medical treatments and lifestyle changes.[9]MedicationA number of medications are available to help manage chronic bronchitis, by treating the symptoms. The chosen treatment route will depend on the severity of the condition.Bronchodilator: A medicinal substance breathed in through an inhaler which helps open up the bronchial tubes and aids breathing.
Theophylline: Particularly useful for treating shortness of breath, this oral medication relaxes the muscles in the airways in order to help with breathing. Usually, this is only used under direct medical supervision, in a clinical setting.
Steroids: Corticosteroids help bring bring many of the condition’s symptoms under control, specifically by reducing both mucus production and the inflammation of the bronchial tubes.Lifestyle changesThere are a number of lifestyle changes that can be made to help manage chronic bronchitis, including:Quitting smoking: Smoking is the leading cause of chronic bronchitis and can help aggravate its symptoms. See below for further information.
Avoiding irritants: Those who live in areas with high levels of air pollution, or those who come into regular contact with other airborne irritants should wear a mask or take other steps to avoid them.
Use a humidifier: Regular exposure to warm, moist air from a humidifier can be helpful in managing symptoms.
Exercise: Ideally for at least 30 minutes, three days per week. Exercise can help strengthen the muscles used to breathe.Those experiencing chronic bronchitis may also benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), a program designed to help improve the overall well-being of those with respiratory problems. Typically, the program will involve exercise training, nutritional education, breathing strategies and counselling.[10]How to quit smokingQuitting smoking is often a very difficult process but it is vital for treating, as well as preventing, chronic bronchitis.The first step in quitting smoking should be a consultation with a doctor or healthcare provider who will be able to outline the best way to quit, taking into consideration a person’s individual needs and medical history.[11]A combination of behavioral changes and medication is often the most effective way of quitting. Behavioral changes include avoiding situations in which you are around people smoking, or situations in which you would typically smoke yourself, as well as taking steps to avoid stress, such as taking up a new exercise regimen. Learning to recognise cravings and devising methods of counteracting them may also be useful.[11]Several medications are available to aid people in nicotine withdrawal. Some of these are available over the counter, others may require a prescription from a doctor. The overarching name for this method of treatment is nicotine replacement therapy. Medication is available in a variety of forms, including patches, gum and lozenges, and can be effective in reducing the intensity of cravings and gradually weaning people off their addiction to nicotine.[11]","Chronic bronchitis cannot always be avoided. However, taking certain steps will lessen a person’s chances of developing the condition. These include:[12]Stopping or never starting smoking: Ideally, smoking should be avoided completely. Those who have already started should stop.
Wearing a mask: Avoid irritants in the air by wearing a mask when outdoors.
Controlling asthma: Managing the symptoms of asthma may be useful in avoiding chronic bronchitis.","Q: Is chronic bronchitis contagious?
A: Chronic bronchitis is not contagious – it is principally caused by smoking or exposure to irritants, meaning that it cannot be passed from person to person.[15]Q: What is the difference between chronic bronchitis and emphysema?
A: Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are both types of obstructive pulmonary disease – an umbrella term for lung conditions that affect a person’s ability to breathe. Though the symptoms of each are similar, the way they affect the lungs is significantly different. Emphysema is a condition in which the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs become distended and thereby deteriorate, whereas chronic bronchitis is a long-term inflammation of the lungs.[16]Q: How can I tell if my cough is caused by chronic bronchitis?
A: A cough caused by chronic bronchitis can typically be differentiated from a cough caused by another condition by its duration and the other symptoms that accompany it. A chronic bronchitis cough will typically persist for at least three months and be accompanied by the bringing up of mucus, which may contain traces of blood and be green, yellow or clear in color.Q: Is chronic bronchitis linked to lung cancer?
A: Research suggests that chronic bronchitis is associated with a higher risk of developing lung cancer. Although the exact reason behind this is not completely clear, cigarette smoking is thought to play a role.[17]"
Chronic Gastritis,https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-gastritis/,,"The majority of people infected with H. pylori do not develop any symptoms and present no complications.[6]People who experience symptoms from chronic gastritis rather than its various complications, may experience:[1][7]Pain or an ache in the upper abdomen
Nausea
Vomiting
A feeling of being full
Feeling hungry combined with reduced appetite
Pain while fasting
Pain after eatingPeople experiencing possible symptoms of chronic gastritis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.Symptoms of type A autoimmune chronic gastritisPeople with autoimmune chronic gastritis will not generally experience pain or will not experience pain as strongly as those with chronic gastritis caused by H. pylori or NSAIDs.[8]The main symptom with autoimmune chronic gastritis is pernicious anemia, caused by a lack of vitamin B12, or iron deficiency anemia.[8][9]Symptoms of pernicious anemia include:[9][10][11]Diarrhea
Feeling dizzy or clumsy
Feeling tired
Abnormalities in gait
Having shortness of breath, especially when exercising
Reduced taste and smell
Brittle nails and dry skin
Numbness or pins and needles
Lack of concentration
Psychiatric or cognitive symptomsSymptoms of iron deficiency anemia include:[12][13]Feeling tired
Shortness of breath
Headache
Heart palpitations
Pale skin
Tinnitus
Brittle nails and dry skinSome people with autoimmune chronic gastritis may experience a full feeling in the upper abdomen after eating, feel nauseous or vomit. Although most people with the condition do not experience pain, some may feel pain in the abdomen.[14]ComplicationsChronic gastritis can lead to other conditions if not properly managed. These include:Atrophic gastritisIf left untreated, severe chronic gastritis can develop into atrophic gastritis. This is where the protective mucus layer in the stomach is damaged, leading to loss of gastric glandular cells, which is compensated by cells usually found in the intestine. Eventually, gastric glandular cells are replaced by intestinal and fibrous tissue. This process is known as intestinal metaplasia (IM) of the stomach, and those affected are at increased risk of gastric cancer compared to the general population, although this is still a low risk overall.[3][4][6][15]Atrophic gastritis on its own does not tend to cause symptoms. It is often diagnosed during an internal examination of the stomach after a person exhibits other signs of gastritis, such as:[3]Stomach pain
Nausea and vomiting
BloatingStomach ulcersA stomach ulcer is a sore in the lining of the stomach, caused by damage to the stomach lining due to prolonged exposure to gastric acid. Eight out of 10 stomach ulcers, also known as peptic ulcers, are linked to infection with H. pylori. Long-term use of NSAID painkillers is another cause.Symptoms of a stomach ulcer include:[16][17][18]Burning pain in the stomach
Nausea and retching
Vomiting
Bloating or feeling full
Belching
Heartburn
Changes in appetite
Unplanned weight loss
Difficulty breathing
Feeling faint
Vomiting blood
Blood in stools
Stools that appear black or tarryThese symptoms usually:[17][19]Appear on an empty stomach
Last for minutes or possibly hours
Appear on and off over several weeks
Can be stopped for a short time by taking antacidsGastric polypsGastric polyps are growths that form in the lining of the stomach. They do not usually cause symptoms, but when they do, these can include:[20][21]Anemia
Tender stomach when pressed
In rare cases, bleedingMost gastric polyps are benign, but some can develop into gastric cancers.[22]","If the protective layer of mucus in the stomach is damaged, gastric acids can irritate the stomach lining.In around 90% of cases, chronic gastritis is caused by the bacteria H. pylori.[4] This bacteria creates an inflammation of the stomach lining and, gradually, stomach cells become damaged. H. pylori is usually acquired in childhood, though symptoms do not develop until later in life.Another cause of damage to the mucus layer is the repeated use of NSAID drugs, such as aspirin, and excessive consumption of alcohol. These substances can irritate the mucus lining of the stomach. A small number of cases of chronic gastritis are caused by an autoimmune reaction.[23][24]Causes of autoimmune chronic gastritisAn autoimmune reaction can also cause chronic gastritis. The body’s autoimmune response causes an inflammation of the protective mucus lining of the stomach, which eventually atrophies the mucus-producing cells. This leads to fewer mucus-producing cells being available and, consequently, less protection for the stomach. This is accompanied by a loss of parietal cells in the stomach, which regulate stomach acid. Parietal cells also affect absorption of vitamin B12 and iron by the stomach, so their loss may cause malabsorption.[8]It is not known what causes the autoimmune reaction, but people with autoimmune chronic gastritis often have other autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroiditis, Addison’s disease or type I diabetes.[8][14]","To assist with the diagnosis of chronic gastritis, a doctor will take the person’s medical history, including their use of medications such as aspirin, NSAIDs and antacids, as well as alcohol consumption and travel to countries where H. pylori is endemic. They will also conduct a physical examination of the abdomen.Depending on these factors, a number of tests may be used for a diagnosis:[7]Testing for H. pylori: These tests may include a blood, stool or breath test.
Blood test for anemia
Stool test for the presence of bloodOther tests may include:EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy), also called gastroscopy or upper endoscopy: An EGD is a visual inspection of the stomach lining, performed by passing an endoscope – a long, thin, flexible tube with a lighted camera – down the throat and into the esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. The doctor can examine the stomach lining for signs of inflammation and take a small tissue sample (biopsy) to test for H. pylori.[28] An EGD is the best diagnostic tool for autoimmune chronic gastritis.[8]Upper gastrointestinal (GI) series: Also called a barium swallow, this test creates a series of X-rays of the GI tract. Swallowing a liquid containing barium coats the inside of the stomach, esophagus and small intestine to make the organs, as well as any potential ulcer presence, polyps or other abnormality, more visible by X-ray.","How chronic gastritis is treated depends on the underlying cause. If the condition is caused by prolonged and excessive use of NSAIDs or alcohol, the person will need to stop taking those substances. A medical professional will be able to assist with replacement painkillers or with any withdrawal effects.[23]TreatingH. pyloriAntibiotics can treat H. pylori infection. Ridding the body of these bacteria will usually cure the gastritis.[7] However, there is still not enough evidence to determine whether curing the infection can reverse intestinal metaplasia and reduce the risk of cancer.[6][29]Treatment for autoimmune chronic gastritisCurrently, there is no treatment available that will cure autoimmune chronic gastritis. However, the vitamin B12 and iron deficiencies that it causes can be treated with supplements, in the form of tablets, shots or intravenous infusions.[8][14]Follow-up endoscopies may be recommended to monitor development of atrophic gastritis and detect early signs of gastric cancer.[14]Diet and home remediesDiet does not play a role in causing chronic gastritis, though to ease symptoms, people may find it advisable to stop eating things that irritate the stomach, such as fatty, spicy or highly acidic foods. Some people choose to reduce foods containing lactose or gluten.Other lifestyle changes that may help include eating smaller, more frequent meals rather than larger meals, weight reduction and stress management.Over the counter medicines, such as antacids, may ease symptoms but will not address the underlying problem. Over-the-counter medicines should not be taken often and relied upon. A medical professional should be consulted if symptoms persist.",[],"Q: Is there a cure for chronic gastritis?
A: Chronic gastritis caused by H. pylori bacteria or by use of NSAIDs or alcohol can be cured by either eliminating the bacteria or discontinuing use of the substance. However, if a person has had chronic gastritis for a long time, some of the damage to the stomach may be permanent.Q: Is chronic gastritis dangerous?
A: Chronic gastritis is not dangerous, unless it develops into a more serious stage. If chronic gastritis progresses to atrophic gastritis it can increase the risk of developing ulcers, polyps, anemia and gastric cancers.Q: Is chronic gastritis the same as antral gastritis?
A: Gastritis can affect any part of the stomach, but antral gastritis affects only the lower portion, known as the antrum. Causes are the same, but symptoms may also include indigestion and flatulence."
Chronic Heart Failure,https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-heart-failure/,,"The symptoms of chronic heart failure generally depend on the type of the condition being experienced and its location, i.e. which ventricle is involved.[2]The main symptom of left-sided chronic heart failure is shortness of breath, which will generally become worse with activity or when lying flat. A cough may also present. If the condition is affecting the right-side of the heart, edema, a buildup of fluid causing swelling of the legs and ankles, is the most commonly experienced symptom.Other symptoms, which may present regardless of which side of the heart is affected, may include:[1][2]Tiredness
Dizziness or lightheadedness
Nausea
Loss of appetite
Constipation
Weakness, commonly of the legs
Rapid heart rate, even when resting, or an irregular heartbeat
Chest pain or anginaDoctors generally classify a person’s heart failure according to the severity of the symptoms being experienced. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification system is the commonly used grading system. People are sorted into four categories:[3]I: Physical activity is not limited by symptoms.
II: Physical activity is slightly limited. Rest is comfortable.
III Physical activity is markedly limited. Rest is comfortable.
IV: Unable to carry out physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms are present while resting.",[],"Diagnosis is typically based on a person’s medical history, a physical examination and a series of tests. Tests are used by doctors to identify the underlying cause of the chronic heart failure and may include:[1][2]Echocardiogram (ultrasound): This test uses high-frequency sound waves to provide doctors with an insight into the different functions of the heart. It is considered the most important tool in the diagnosis of heart failure.
Electrocardiogram (ECG):  Used to test and record the heart’s rhythm and electrical activity.
Chest X-ray: Able to give doctors a picture of the heart. Can also reveal if there is a buildup of fluid.
Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP): A blood test to measure BNP or NT-proBNP protein levels, both of which tend to be elevated in people with heart failure.In some cases, other tests, including urine tests and MRI scans, may also be used.","Once diagnosed, people with chronic heart failure will work closely with their doctors to create a treatment plan that works for them. In most cases, this plan will include a variety of lifestyle and dietary changes, as well as medications.Lifestyle and dietary changesLifestyle and dietary changes that are often recommended for people with chronic heart failure include:[1][5]Stopping smoking: People who smoke should stop. Doctors are able to advise on the best methods of doing this.
Limiting alcohol intake: If a person’s condition was caused by alcohol consumption, they should stop. Doctors are able to advise on the best methods of doing this.
Losing weight: If a person is overweight, they should lose weight. This can lessen the strain placed on the heart.
Taking regular exercise: Exercise can help to reduce symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue. Before beginning a new exercise regimen, however, a person should consult their doctor about how to do this in a safe way.
Limiting salt intake: Salt can cause the retention of excess fluid in the body. By managing the amount of salt in one’s diet, therefore, chronic heart failure can be managed. A doctor will advise on how much salt should be consumed.
Weighing yourself daily: It is important for people who have been diagnosed with chronic heart failure to weigh themselves daily. If a person’s weight increases by around 2 kg (roughly 4 lb) over a period of 1 to 3 days, they should contact a doctor. This is a sign of fluid retention and may require intervention.People with severe chronic heart failure may be asked to limit the amount of fluid, including water, they consume. Doctors will advise on exactly how much fluid to drink and how to do this in a safe way.MedicationsThe type of medications prescribed will depend on the type of chronic heart failure being experienced, its underlying causes and its severity. In many cases, a combination of medications will be necessary; this combination may need to be altered over time, depending on whether hypertension and left ventricular ejection fraction has been controlled, and, importantly, whether the affected person is still displaying symptoms.Some of the most common medications prescribed to help manage chronic heart failure include:[2]Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: ACE inhibitors can help to prevent a buildup of fluid and may be able to slow the progression of heart failure.
Beta blockers: Usually taken in combination with ACE inhibitors, this type of medication can help to protect the heart and slow the progression of heart failure.
Diuretics (water tablets): This type of medication helps the kidneys to pass extra urine, helping to ease excess fluid retention.
Mineralocorticoid/aldosterone receptor antagonists (MRAs): This type of medication also helps to prevent excess fluid retention.Doctors will advise on how and when to take medications. Reading the enclosed instruction leaflet is also recommended.Other treatment methodsIn some cases, alternative treatment methods may be recommended by doctors. Often, these methods will be used to treat the underlying cause of chronic heart failure.Devices, such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and pacemakers, may be fitted in some people. In some severe cases, surgery to replace or fix the affected heart valve may be recommended. In rare cases, a heart transplant or the implantation of a left ventricular assist device may be necessary.","A number of measures can be taken to help lessen the risk of developing chronic heart failure. These include:Taking regular exercise, such as walking or swimming
Maintaining a healthy weight
Maintaining a healthy and nutritious diet with plenty of vegetables and lean meats
Limiting alcohol intake
Stopping smokingIt is also important to address any underlying risk factors, such as high blood pressure and anemia. Doctors are able to advise on how best to manage these conditions.",[]
Chronic Idiopathic Constipation,https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-idiopathic-constipation/,,"Infrequent bowel movements and difficulty passing stool, are the most common symptoms. If you experience any of the symptoms listed below more than 25% of the time for six months or more, you may need to be assessed for CIC:[1][2][4]Straining
Hard stools
A feeling of incomplete evacuation, i.e. a sensation of stool remaining in the bowel after defecating
A feeling of blockage in the anus or rectum
Use of manual maneuvers; using the hands; to facilitate defecationIn addition, a major symptom is having fewer than three bowel movements a week.Good to know: Irritable Bowel Syndrome shares some symptoms with chronic idiopathic constipation, but people with IBS report pain and bloating more often than people with CIC, and report that their symptoms improve after defecation. This is not the case with CIC. People with CIC almost never experience diarrhea without using laxatives.[1] They also experience normal loose stools only rarely. For more information on Irritable Bowel Syndrome, see this resourceThere are several gastroenterological symptoms which indicate that chronic constipation may have a serious medical condition as its underlying cause, rather than being idiopathic. These include:[2][3][4]Distended abdomen/severe bloating
Vomiting
Blood in the stool
Hematochezia[5]
Unintended weight loss
Anemia
Severe constipation of recent onset
Rapid worsening of constipation
Family history of colon or rectal cancerThese symptoms are more likely to indicate a serious underlying condition in people who are over 50 years of age at the time of symptoms first appearing.Good to know: Constipation is a possible symptom of colorectal cancer, a common gastroenterological cancer that usually affects people who are older than 60 years of age. It is associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. For more information on colorectal cancer, see this resource.","CIC is most commonly seen in women and older adults. The causes of chronic idiopathic constipation are largely unknown. However, possible causes include a reduction in fluid and fiber intake in the diet, changes in water balance, and changes in contractility of the colon.There are several different forms of CIC, including chronic idiopathic constipation:[4]Normal transit constipation, where the stool may be harder than normal and therefore more difficult to pass, but moves through the colon at a normal speed
Slow transit constipation, where stools move through the colon more slowly than usual
Disorders of defecation or evacuationDisorders of defecation or evacuation include:[1][4]Rectocele, a condition where the wall of the rectum bulges into the wall of the vagina inside the body and forms a pouch
Rectal prolapse, a condition where the rectum protrudes through the anus and becomes visible outside the body
Dyssynergic dysfunctionDyssynergic dysfunction arises from problematic co-ordination of the various muscles and sphincters that control defecation. Defecation requires the muscles involved to coordinate the creation  of increasing pressure inside the rectum, followed by relaxation of the internal and external anal sphincters and relaxation of the perineal muscles.[1] This requires the coordination of the pelvic floor muscles, abdominal muscles, and the muscles in the rectum.[4]If these structures do not work together, defecation becomes difficult. People experiencing dyssynergic dysfunction often report a feeling of obstruction and incomplete evacuation. Complications of dyssynergic dysfunction include rectocele, anal fissure and rectal prolapse.In some cases, chronic constipation may be caused by certain medications, such as:[3]Antihistamines
Antipsychotic medications
Antispasmodic medications
Opioids
General anesthetics
Antiparkinsonian drugsGood to know: Medication-related constipation may be chronic (long-lasting) or acute (short-term), and may improve if use of the medication that is causing it is stopped.","The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms that a person is experiencing and on conducting a physical examination. To confirm the diagnosis, all other causes of constipation – for example a medical condition, or medication – should be excluded.Doctors who treat constipation are often specialists in gastroenterology. There are various international gastroenterological criteria that help doctors to determine whether CIC, rather than IBS, is present.Some tests that may be done to aid diagnosis include:[2][4]Colonoscopy, in which an endoscopic camera is inserted into the colon, used to identify structural problems. See this resource for more information on preparing for a colonoscopy.
Blood tests to check for infection and other disorders. See this resource for more information on blood test results.** Colonoscopy** is used conservatively. MRI scans are also used sometimes.Good to know: If the person with CIC does not meet the criteria for being at high risk of colorectal cancer, doctors will usually be conservative about ordering diagnostic tests** and instead rely on taking a history from the affected person and evaluating their symptoms. Tests such as manometry, motility capsules, Sitz markers and scintigraphy are generally rarely used.","As it is not possible to determine the cause of CIC, the treatment options tend to be limited. Dietary changes, like increasing dietary fiber and water intake are usually helpful, as is doing regular physical exercise. However, diet, fluid intake and exercise are not uniformly effective, and some people with CIC may be recommended to use:[1][2]Fibre supplements such as psyllium, calcium polycarbophil, inulin and maltodextrin
Osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol or lactulose
Stimulant laxatives such as bisacodyl, glycerol or sodium picosulfateLaxatives can help with softening stool and improving regularity of bowel movements. Fibre supplements have a similar effect.People who do not find that laxatives provide enough relief from the symptoms of CIC, or for whom laxatives are not recommended, may find serotonin agonists, such as prucalopride or velusetrag, useful.However, the main medications that are recommended when laxatives do not work or cannot be used are lubiprostone (a fatty acid) and linaclotide (an oligo-peptide agonist).[1] These medications work by increasing the amount of chloride that is secreted into the gut, which increases the amount of fluid in the gut, which in turn stimulates bowel movements.[2] One side effect of linaclotide is diarrhea. Otherwise, both drugs are very effective for CIC.People with CIC resulting from dyssynergic dysfunction may find biofeedback useful. (see FAQs). If done by a trained therapist, biofeedback can be used to correct incorrect defecatory technique and in that way “retrain” the pelvic floor.[1]Probiotics, which replenish or balance the growth of healthy intestinal bacteria, may be helpful for some people.",[],"Q: How should CIC be treated in children? 
A: Young children may not be able to describe the symptoms of chronic idiopathic constipation to their caregivers, so it is important to be vigilant for signs of abdominal distress or discomfort in children, especially surrounding bowel movements. Treating constipation in children promptly can prevent it from becoming chronic. Frequent soiling is a symptom of CIC which is specific to children.[6] Children may experience feelings of shame and therefore not report discomfort to their caregivers. In addition, the feelings of discomfort and difficulty during bowel movements may mean that children begin to resist going to the bathroom or withhold stool.[7]CIC in children can arise due to a number of different factors, such as a low-fiber diet and or taking certain medications, that may interact with one another.[8] While the condition cannot be cured, it can be treated. Treatment options include laxatives and enemas, as well as a special individualized diet. Children with CIC may be treated by teams of specialists including gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons and urologists.[9]Q: Do people with CIC need to be hospitalized??
A: People with CIC do not need to be hospitalized in most cases. Treatment procedures such as management of fecal impaction, use of laxatives, the administration of enemas, biofeedback therapy, and the manual management of minor rectal prolapse can all be done as outpatient procedures or at home.[10]However, complications that may arise from CIC, such as moderate or severe rectal prolapse and rectocele may need surgical treatment, and this will involve hospitalization.[11][12] In very rare cases, people with chronic idiopathic constipation related to obstruction or slow transit may need surgery to remove a portion of the sigmoid colon.[13][14]Q: Are there any home remedies that can help manage chronic idiopathic constipation?
A: Taking steps to manage chronic idiopathic constipation at home is possible, and home management often accompanies medical treatment.Weight management, plentiful fluid intake and regular exercise are important in preventing severe constipation. Eating a diet high in fibre is also helpful in most cases. Although it is anecdotally believed that hot coffee beverages can stimulate bowel movements, this has not been conclusively scientifically established.[15]Some people with CIC may find following a low FODMAP diet helpful, as it can reduce bloating, flatulence and cramps, as well as diarrhea or constipation. FODMAP stands for “Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols”, short-chain carbohydrates which are poorly absorbed by the body.It should be noted that a low FODMAP diet is generally considered to be more useful in cases of IBS than CIC.[16] Because FODMAP can become complicated, people who are considering it as a method of managing CIC or IBS should consult a dietitian first.Q: What is biofeedback?
A: Biofeedback is a method by which people can learn to control bodily processes that were previously believed to be involuntary or out of their control. Biofeedback can be used to treat symptoms, as well as boost overall wellness. It should be noted that, although it is non-invasive, painless, and usually free of side effects,[17] biofeedback needs to be done by a qualified therapist and requires input and effort from the person receiving biofeedback as treatment.[18]In people affected by constipation, biofeedback is concentrated on learning to voluntarily relax the muscles that govern the opening and closing of the anal sphincter muscles.[17] The process uses a computer, special sensors that are placed inside the body, and verbal reinforcement and encouragement from the therapist. It is usually completely painless.In biofeedback, sensors measure electrical currents produced by the activity of muscles in the affected areas. These currents are displayed as information on a computer monitor. Being able to see muscle movement in an easily-understandable form like this helps the affected person to visualise what is happening inside their body.[19] In this way, they can learn what is happening and how to control it."
Chronic Laryngitis,https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-laryngitis/,,"Typical symptoms of long-lasting laryngitis include vocal hoarseness, sore throat, a cough, and swallowing problems. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.","Laryngeal symptoms such as cough, sore throat and hoarse voice are frequently caused by prolonged irritation of the larynx and vocal cords. If laryngitis persists for weeks or months, this can result in vocal cord strain and injuries and growths or polyps developing on the vocal cords.Non-infectious causes of persistent laryngitis can include overuse of the voice; which puts a strain on the larynx; overuse of alcohol, gastric reflux, smoking or cancer. Bacterial infections rarely cause chronic laryngitis.","Because laryngitis is usually acute, meaning that it goes away on its own after around two weeks, it is wise to seek medical attention if symptoms, including hoarseness of the voice due to inflamed vocal cords, sore throat and/or cough, remain present after this time. The diagnosis of persistent laryngitis is usually made by assessing the symptoms and examining the throat.","Treatment for long-lasting laryngitis depends on the source of the issue. If the laryngitis is caused by gastric reflux, that underlying condition should be treated. If the inflammation is caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotic medications are normally taken.Aside from addressing the root cause with appropriate medications and/or therapies, treatment for persistent laryngitis mainly involves resting the voice and soothing the throat, to give the larynx and vocal cords a chance to heal. Self-care remedies that may be helpful include:Giving up tobacco products, especially smoking, which can dry out the throat and vocal cords.
Choosing non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic beverages, which can dehydrate the body, aggravating laryngeal symptoms.
Drinking plenty of water, to thin mucus in the throat, so that it clears easily. This decreases congestion and helps minimise the need to cough.
Using natural products that fight infection like ginger and turmeric extracts. These can be added to hot drinks, can reduce the need to cough and help fight infection.
Keeping clean by using antibacterial handwashes and wipes at regular intervals throughout the day, particularly after coughing. This will also help prevent the transmission of laryngeal infection to others.
Avoiding breathing in fumes from smoke or household chemicals, which can cause vocal cord irritation.","Prevention can be achieved by treatment of a gastric reflux condition, avoidance of smoking and smoke exposure, and moderate use of the voice.",[]
Chronic Pelvic Pain,https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-pelvic-pain/,,"The most typical symptom of the condition is pain in the area below the belly button, which must last for a period of at least six months to be considered chronic pelvic pain. The specific characteristics and location of the pain typically differs from person to person. The specifics of each case are often helpful in identifying the cause of the pain.Other possible symptoms of chronic pelvic pain include:Abdominal tenderness
Pain or difficulty while urinating
A feeling following urination that the bladder has not been completely emptied
Waking frequently during the night with the need to urinate
Pain or difficulty during sexual intercourse
Pain during menstruation, normally accompanied by abdominal cramps
Headaches","The pelvis is the lowest portion of the abdomen, containing many organs and complex layers of muscles, nerves and blood vessels. The pain associated with the condition can originate from any part of the pelvis. The reasons why some people develop chronic pain are not well understood.The pain can come from the digestive tract, the gynecological organs – the uterus or ovaries, for example – the bladder, or from the bones, muscles or nerves in and around the pelvis. The condition most commonly affects women between the ages of 26 and 30. People who have experienced traumatic or highly stressful events or circumstances are more likely to develop chronic pelvic pain.","A diagnosis will usually be made by a doctor or gynecologist based on the symptoms and a thorough examination of the pelvic area, including a gynecological exam. It can be difficult to identify the exact source of the pain, often making a number of diagnostic tests necessary. This may involve blood tests, urine analysis and smear samples from the vagina and cervix, as well as ultrasound or CT scans.","The treatment method for chronic pelvic pain depends on the underlying cause of the condition and most often consists of managing the symptoms.If the cause is gynecological or muscular, for example, simple pain-relieving medications, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol may be helpful. Physiotherapy, regular exercise and the maintenance of good bowel function may also be helpful for some people. To help process the diagnosis and find strategies to manage the pain, support groups or counseling may also be recommended.",[],[]
Chronic Pharyngitis,https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-pharyngitis/,,"The symptoms of chronic pharyngitis resemble those of acute pharyngitis, and include:[2][3]Discomfort or pain in the throat
Cough
Hoarseness
A tickling sensation in the throat
A sensation of something stuck in the throat
Difficulty swallowing
A tired voice, more common among people who sing or speak for a living
Headache
FeverThe Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.","Chronic pharyngitis has many potential underlying causes, and if a sore throat does not clear up even after a course of antibiotics, it is best to seek further medical advice. Chronic pharyngitis may be caused by factors such as:Smoke or environmental pollutants
Infection
Allergies or allergic reactions, such as eosinophilic esophagitis
Acid reflux
Throat cancer, in rare casesSmoke and environmental pollutantsSmoke contains fine particles of solid, gas and liquid matter carried in air, and may include harmful chemicals as well as fragments of burnt material.[4] Smoke may be generated by burning tobacco, wood, grass, coal, plastic, structures, burn pits, landfill fires, traffic exhaust, industrial exhaust or almost any other combustible material or activity that involves carbon combustion.[5]The exact chemicals and particles carried in smoke depend on what is producing the smoke. Fine particle pollution is a common problem in urban areas as well as in households and undeveloped areas that rely on wood and coal fires for heat and/or cooking.The degree to which smoke and other airborne environmental pollutants can cause throat pain and lung problems varies from person to person, but, when problems occur, they commonly manifest as a dry, sore throat, runny nose and coughing.[6] Long-term or frequent exposure to smoke can cause persistent pharyngitis.Persistent tonsillitisAnother common cause of persistent sore throat is an infection of the structures in or surrounding the throat. In people who still have their tonsils, these are the structures most often affected. This is known as tonsillitis, and other symptoms that may be present include:[7][8]Cough
Fever
Nausea and vomiting
Painful swallowing
Swollen lymph glands
Headache
Abdominal painAllergic rhinitisAllergic rhinitis is also known as hay fever and is a condition in which the body’s immune system responds aggressively to harmless particles such as pollen, mold or pet dander. Depending on what triggers the immune response, allergic rhinitis can cause symptoms seasonally or all year.[9]In allergic rhinitis, the body responds to the allergen by releasing histamines, which cause the lining of the sinuses, eyes and nostrils to become inflamed. Nasal congestion, sneezing, postnasal drip and an itchy throat are all common symptoms of allergic rhinitis.[10] See this resource on hay fever for more information.Good to know: In postnasal drip, the mucus glands of the nose and throat produce excessive amounts of thick mucus, which can cause the pharynx to feel swollen and irritated.[11]Postnasal drip and the itchy, painful throat associated with allergic rhinitis can both cause a recurring or constant sore throat.Laryngo-pharyngeal refluxLaryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is a disorder associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), in which reflux of digestive acids from the stomach reaches the back of the throat and the nasal airway. In adults, the symptoms include:[12]Burning sensations or pain in the throat.
Hoarseness.
Postnasal drip.
Difficulty swallowing.
A sensation of something stuck in the throat.The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.LPR can be caused by dietary problems, abnormalities of the sphincters of the esophagus and being overweight. In many cases, certain foods may be associated with LPR. These include:[13]Alcohol
Caffeine
Fatty foods
Spicy foodsStress and smoking can also cause LPR. It is possible to have LPR without having GERD, or to have GERD without having LPR.Eosinophilic esophagitisEosinophilic esophagitis is a disorder of the esophagus, in which allergic reactions cause the esophagus to become irritated and sometimes to narrow.[14]. This irritation may result from food allergies or environmental allergies.It is not possible to diagnose eosinophilic esophagitis using standard allergy tests, and it is difficult to pinpoint which foods are causing the problem, as allergic reactions are often delayed in this disorder.[15]Symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis include:[14][15]Throat pain
Heartburn
Difficulty swallowing, especially dry or dense foods.
Painful swallowing
Recurring abdominal pain
Nausea and vomiting
Food becoming lodged in the narrowed esophagus.Children with this disorder may refuse to eat, fail to thrive or vomit after meals, in addition to the above symptoms.Food becoming lodged in the esophagus (food impaction) is a medical emergency in children and adults, and if it occurs, medical help should be sought immediately.Throat cancerThroat cancer is a fairly rare cause of chronic sore throat, but is nevertheless quite serious should it occur. Throat cancer generally begins in the larynx (voice-box) or the pharynx,[16] and throat pain is only one of a number of symptoms. Other symptoms include:[16][17]Difficulty swallowing
Sore throat
Shortness of breath
Chronic cough
Changes in the voice/hoarseness
Feeling of something stuck in the throat
Lumps in the neck or throat
Swelling of the neck
Bleeding in the mouth or nose
Unplanned, unexplained weight lossThe most important risk factors for throat cancer are smoking and alcohol consumption.[16][17]","Chronic pharyngitis often indicates the presence of an underlying problem, and treatment to relieve it includes treating the underlying cause.To relieve the sore throat itself, people with chronic pharyngitis can gargle with warm saline solutions, stay well-hydrated, avoid smoking and manage pain with over-the-counter medication such as acetaminophen/paracetamol. However, the underlying cause must be addressed.In cases of chronic pharyngitis caused by smoke or environmental pollutants, the person must be removed from the environment where the smoke is present.Tonsillitis is generally treated with an intensive course of antibiotics. If the disorder recurs often, or is particularly severe, tonsillectomy may be considered. A tonsillectomy is a relatively minor surgical procedure and is not associated with much postoperative pain.[7]Allergic rhinitis is often treated with nasal sprays, saline sprays and over-the-counter allergy medications.[18] In more severe cases, an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist should be consulted.Laryngo-pharyngeal reflux can be treated with lifestyle changes to remove triggers, such as stress and excess weight, dietary changes and medication. Proton-pump inhibitors, such as esomeprazole or omeprazole are often the first-line medications used to treat LRP in cases where lifestyle changes do not seem to be sufficient.[19]People whose LPR is the result of physical abnormalities in the esophagus may need surgery to alleviate the disorder.Eosinophilic esophagitis is usually diagnosed by a gastroenterologist or an ENT specialist and is treated with elimination or elemental diets to isolate and then remove the food triggers. Alongside the diet plan, symptoms may be treated with corticosteroids,[14] and proton-pump inhibitors.[15]Throat cancer treatment depends on the type of cancer, its location, and how advanced it is.[16]If a diagnosis of throat cancer is confirmed, treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Surgery results in cure for up to eight in ten cases of early-stage throat cancer[20], while radiotherapy is also often successful. In some cases, surgery and radiotherapy may be used in combination.[20]",[],[],[]
Chronic Renal Failure,https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-renal-failure/,,"In the early stages of chronic renal failure, affected people often do not experience any symptoms. However, symptoms that may emerge during the early stages of chronic renal failure include:[3][4]The urge to urinate more frequently
Urine may be pale and foamy
Hypertension (high blood pressure)
Swelling of the legs
Poor appetite
Weight lossAs the condition progresses, affected people may develop other symptoms such as:[3][4][5][6]Muscle cramps or twitches
Developing brown spots on the skin
Worsening of swelling, including on the hands, ankles, feet and around the eyes
Lack of concentration or drowsiness
Feeling lethargic and without energy
Bruising easily
Blood in the stool
Amenorrhea (periods stopping)
Itchy, dry skin
Pain in the bones
Increased susceptibility to infection
Nausea and vomitingComplications of chronic renal failureIf kidney disease progresses, it can lead to kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease. This means that the kidneys will no longer be able to process waste and remove it from the body. This will require dialysis or, potentially, a kidney transplant.[3][4]AnemiaAnemia is a common condition in people with chronic renal failure that tends to occur after a person loses 20 to 50 percent of kidney function. Damaged kidneys do not produce enough of a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO), which promotes the creation of red blood cells.[7]For more information, see the resource about anemia.Vitamin D deficiencyPeople with chronic renal failure do not process vitamin D as efficiently as people with healthy kidneys and are at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Some of the problems this can lead to include:Osteomalacia
Osteoporosis
Increased susceptibility to infection","Chronic renal failure mostly occurs in people who have other medical conditions which cause damage to the small units in the kidneys, called nephrons, which are responsible for filtering waste and fluid from the blood.Common conditions which can cause chronic renal failure include:[1]Diabetes: One in three adults with diabetes are likely to develop chronic renal failure
Hypertension: One in five adults with high blood pressure are likely to develop chronic renal failurePeople with diabetes and hypertension, who are at high risk of developing chronic renal failure, should have regular health checks to measure their glomerular filtration rate. Diabetics should also have regular microalbumin tests. These tests can detect early signs of the condition.Less common conditions that can cause chronic renal failure include:[4][8][9]Polycystic kidney disease, a range of genetic disorders
Glomerulonephritis, also called nephritis and nephrotic syndrome, is a condition which damages the glomeruli[10] and can be caused by strep throat and lupus, among other conditions
Inflammation of the kidneys
Repeated kidney infections and frequent kidney stonesPeople who have some malformation of their kidneys or urinary tract are at higher risk of eventually developing chronic renal failure. Once the kidneys have lost a significant amount of function, they may not be able to recover, and the person may progress to end-stage renal disease.","Chronic renal failure can be diagnosed by measuring kidney function and is typically tested for by taking blood and urine samples to measure creatinine levels. This is a waste product of creatine, which is a chemical the body produces to supply energy, primarily to muscles and the brain.[11]The two main diagnostic tests are:[12][13][14]Glomerular filtration rate (GFR): Checks how well the glomeruli[10] are working. To check the filtration rate, a blood sample is taken which is then tested in a lab. The results are combined with factors including age, ethnicity, gender, height and weight to estimate a person’s glomerular filtration rate.
Creatinine clearance test: Another way of calculating the glomerular filtration rate. To perform the test, a person needs to collect all their urine for a 24 hour period and then provide a blood sample. Comparing creatinine levels in the blood and urine allows a person’s glomerular filtration rate to be estimated.If a person has a glomerular filtration rate of less than 60mL/min/1.73m2 for three months or more, they are classed as having chronic renal failure or kidney damage.[15] Normal results are in the 90mL/min/1.73m2 to 120mL/min/1.73m2 range.[12]Additionally, an ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract may be necessary. In some cases, it may be necessary to take a small sample of the kidney (a biopsy) in order to find the underlying cause for the condition.[4]Diabetics should have regular microalbumin tests in addition to other tests. This test is used to detect very small levels of albumin, a protein usually found in the blood, in the urine. If the kidneys are damaged, albumin leaks into urine.[16]","Treatment involves controlling the condition that is harming the kidneys. In particular, people with hypertension or diabetes should make sure that these conditions are well controlled.Keeping blood sugar and blood pressure under control will slow down further kidney damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the preferred option for managing hypertension.[3]Some over-the-counter medications, including vitamins and herbal supplements, can worsen chronic renal failure. It may be helpful to review medications with a doctor and replace or stop any medications which can damage the kidneys.[3]Other medical conditions involving the kidneys can be managed with the help of a nephrologist (a specialist kidney doctor).If chronic renal failure is diagnosed early and carefully managed; this may help to prevent the condition from worsening and progressing to end-stage renal failure. People with kidneys that no longer work well enough to filter blood and fluid may need dialysis, a process in which the blood is cleaned by a machine. Everyone with end-stage renal failure should be evaluated for a kidney transplant.[5]","Good control of medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes is important in preventing chronic renal failure.Other actions that can help prevent chronic renal failure include:[5][17]Regular health check-ups, including evaluation of kidney function in high risk populations
Losing weight
Taking regular exercise, which can help regulate blood pressure and blood sugar levels
Eating a healthy diet
Stopping smoking
Drinking less alcohol
Taking all prescribed medication as directed
Avoiding certain over-the-counter painkillers such as Aspirin or Ibuprofen","Q: What diet should I eat for chronic renal failure?
A: Eating healthily can help slow the progression of chronic renal failure. Eating a diet that contains plenty of fruit and vegetables, is low in fat, cholesterol, salt and potassium, is advisable. Be aware that white beans, bananas, avocados and potatoes contain high amounts of potassium. For diabetics, maintaining blood sugar levels is important."
Cluster Headaches (CHs),https://ada.com/conditions/cluster-headaches/,,"CHs are a subtype of headache called a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC). Headaches of this kind are unilateral, meaning that they affect one side of the head and face:[3]Cephalalgia is the medical term for a dull, persistent, and usually moderately intense, pain in the head region.
The word trigeminal refers to the trigeminal nerve, responsible for sensation in the face and motor functions such as biting and chewing. Correspondingly, the area affected by CHs is the facial area and the eye area in particular. CHs can affect either the left or the right side of the head, but most people find that they are usually affected on the same side each time.
The symptoms of CHs are described as autonomic processes because the body performs them automatically, e.g. a runny nose and teary eyes.The pain associated with a cluster headache develops very suddenly and is incredibly intense. It has been described as an unbearable, piercing, burning and excruciating sensation.[2]The intensity of the pain may cause people to move in an agitated manner during an attack. It is common for people to pace up and down during a headache attack, and some people even report making desperate attempts to bang their heads on walls and objects in response to the intensity of the pain.In addition to its characteristic pain, one or more the following symptoms may be present during a CH:[2][4]On the side of the head affected:A reddened, teary eye
Shrinking of the pupil in the eye
A drooping or swollen eyelid
A blocked and/or stuffy nostrilOther symptoms include:A sweaty face and forehead
A pale or flushed face
Restlessness (pacing and agitated movement)
Spreading of the pain to the face, head, neck and shoulders
A need to avoid light and soundMany people only experience one or two of these symptoms in addition to the painful sensation, and it is possible for a person’s symptoms to vary between attacks. However, most people’s symptoms only vary very slightly from one headache attack to another.[5]Good to know: A cluster headache is also known as a migrainous neuralgia, but is a different kind of headache from a migraine. Migraines are often confused with cluster headaches due to the fact that they can also be very painful and can affect people frequently or in bouts for periods of time, so it is important to be aware of their different characteristics to ensure that a person affected by headaches receives treatment for the appropriate type. See the “Cluster headache FAQs section below and this resource on migraines for more information.Duration and frequencyThe natural duration of a cluster headache is usually approximately between 15 minutes and three hours, if there is no specialized treatment to reduce its pain and duration. CHs usually occur one to eight times per day, at the same time or times. It is most common for CHs to occur at night, one to two hours after falling asleep, waking up the affected person.[6]After the headache, the pain usually alleviates very suddenly, leaving the affected person pain-free, and, usually, physically tired.Episodic cluster headachesIn people with episodic cluster headaches, CHs will occur every day for periods of weeks or months; six to twelve weeks is normal. This is the case in around 80 percent of people affected by CHs.[7]The rest of the time, a person affected by episodic CHs will experience periods of remission with no CHs. These periods of remission may last months or even years before the next cycle of headaches occurs. Periods in which CHs occur, will usually happen at the same time or times each year. Many affected people experience CHs during Spring and Fall.Chronic cluster headachesFor 20 percent of people affected by CHs, the condition is chronic, meaning that the headaches occur all year round rather than in periodic or seasonal cycles. CHs are considered chronic if a bout of CHs lasts for more than a year and/or if periods of remission typically last for less than one month.[7]","Only a small amount of information about the physiological mechanism that leads to cluster headaches is known:CHs are linked to increased activity in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which contains a control centre for many of the functions of the autonomic nervous system. A greater intensity in the activity of the hypothalamus during CH attacks has been detected by brain imaging studies on people affected by CHs.[8] However, the exact relationship between CHs and the activity of the hypothalamus is not yet understood.
CHs are also been linked to a person having elevated levels of histamine,a chemical produced as part of the body’s immune response to allergens. According to historical research into cluster headaches, people affected by CHs are likely to develop a headache attack when histamine is medically administered.[9]
A person’s food intake may contain histamine-rich foods, which can cause CHs. Histamine levels in foods vary, depending on how processed, ripe or matured they are. Foods which are rich in histamine and may cause CHs include: salty foods such as crisps and cured meats, alcohol, vinegar, cocoa and chocolate, shellfish, beans and pulses, and matured cheeses. Keeping a food diary may help to identify foods which are causing CH bouts or attacks.
Elevated levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter; mainly produced in the brain, and found in the nervous system and gut which promotes feelings of well-being, has also been linked to CHs.However, the relationships between having elevated levels of histamine and/or serotonin and the development of CHs are also unknown.Good to know: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) ‒ medications which are used to treat a variety of mental health conditions including depression and anxiety  ‒ are not believed to cause cluster headaches, despite the fact that they increase the level of serotonin in the brain. This is primarily because they are prescribed to raise serotonin levels which are believed to be low.However, it is important that people who are using SSRIs inform their doctor when seeking treatment for CHs: SSRIs have cross-reactivity with certain medications used to treat CHs. For example, the first-line treatment for CHs, sumatriptan, from the triptan class of medications, works by stimulating serotonin receptors in the brain. The stimulation of the serotonin receptors resulting from the use of triptans has an effect called negative feedback regulation on the brain’s 5-HT synthesis. This effect leads to a larger than normal amount of serotonin being available for use by the brain.Due to this effect, triptans may cause serotonin syndrome when used in conjunction with SSRIs. Serotonin syndrome is a condition involving high body temperature, sweating and tremors, occurring as a result of too much serotonin in the body.TriggersIn people who are affected by cluster headaches, certain triggers have been identified which may bring on a bout of cluster headaches. These factors have also been found to trigger headache attacks during a period when a person is experiencing a bout of CHs.Known triggers of CHs  in people already affected by the condition include:[4][10][11]Seasonal changes - CHs are believed to be linked to circadian rhythmicity and are therefore likely to occur as the body adjusts to taking in more or less light during the day: a property of the shoulder seasons rather than the extreme ones.

Cocaine","Anybody who thinks they may have experienced a cluster headache should seek medical attention without waiting for a repeat occurrence. To reduce the potential severity and overall impact of CHs on a person’s quality of life, it is important to diagnose and begin treating the condition as soon as possible.There are no specialized diagnostic tests to establish whether a person is affected by cluster headaches. To diagnose CHs, a doctor will assess the following criteria:Brain function: In order to rule out any neurological problems, such as brain or vessel abnormalities, which may be the cause of the headache(s), a brain scan will be performed. If any previously-unknown abnormalities are revealed, these will be considered to be the cause of the headaches, and a diagnosis of CHs will not be given at this time. Instead, the abnormalities will be investigated further and treated.In otherwise-healthy people affected by CHs, the brain scan will be normal with no abnormalities. Doctors can then be confident that the CH attacks are caused by CH disorder rather than any impairment of brain function.
A person’s medical history, with a focus on whether the person’s symptoms could relate to any other headache disorders.
Whether a person has a family history of cluster headaches. Although the link between genetics and CHs is not understood, people with relatives affected by CHs are more likely to develop the condition.
Whether a person’s experience of their headache(s) matches the diagnostic criteria for a cluster headache, which include having at least one symptom which is ipsilateral (on the same side of the head as the pain) in the eye, nose or face, restlessness or agitation, a duration of 15 minutes to three hours without effective response to medication or painkillers, a frequency of between one attack every other day or eight attacks per day and an incredibly severe pain.Avoiding misdiagnosisDoctors will be aware that a person may be affected by other primary headache disorders, which may result in them experiencing headaches that are similar to cluster headaches. These include:[3][12][13]Trigeminal neuralgia: A chronic pain disorder affecting the same nerve that is involved in cluster headaches.
Migraine: Some headache attacks can feature autonomic features such as teary eyes. Migraines can also often occur in bouts, which leads to the widespread misconception that a person is experiencing cluster headaches, when they are in fact experiencing clusters of migraines.
Hemicrania continua: A chronic, persistent headache that usually occurs on the same side of the face and head, usually consisting of a constant dull pain which intermittently becomes piercing.
Short-lasting, unilateral, neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT): Like CHs, SUNCT headaches are a subtype of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia headaches, but their duration is much shorter than cluster headaches.","People who have been diagnosed with CHs are usually treated by a type of doctors specialising in brain and nerve conditions called a neurologist. Those affected by CHs will require both short and long-term treatment in order to manage their headache disorder:Short-term treatment for CHs focuses on reducing the pain and duration of the headache attack.
Long-term treatment of CHs aims to reduce the frequency of headache attacks and to prolong the periods of remission between bouts. With effective treatment, a person affected by chronic CHs may be able to reduce the frequency of their headaches to the point at which their CH disorder becomes episodic.Short-term treatment: managing a cluster headache attackAfter having diagnosed CHs, doctors will discuss a range of treatments which a person can use during a headache attack in order to relieve their pain. The pain associated with a CH is so severe that it cannot be alleviated with traditional over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers.Specialized treatments for CHs can usually relieve headache pain in 15-30 minutes. These treatments are called abortive agents because they begin to relieve (abort) pain more quickly than OTC painkillers, which are designed to be swallowed. They can be administered by vaporisation, i.e. breathing them in through the nose, or by injection into a muscle, or vein.[14]The principal abortive agents used to relieve the symptoms of a CH attack are oxygen therapy and sumatriptan injections.Oxygen therapyThis treatment involves breathing in pure oxygen through a mask at the start of a CH attack. Masks and containers of pure oxygen will be provided by a person’s doctor, and they will be shown how to use the equipment so that they can carry out this treatment themselves, independently, whenever a CH strikes.The rate at which the oxygen is dispensed from the container can be adjusted, and people are usually recommended to breathe in oxygen at a rate of around 15 litres per minute at the start of the attack, which they can decrease to a rate of six to eight litres per minute when the symptoms subside. It is important to continue breathing in the oxygen for five to ten minutes after the attack has finished, otherwise it may return.Sumatriptan (triptan class medication) injectionsSumatriptan is a medication which is used in the treatment of migraines and cluster headaches. It works by narrowing the blood vessels in the brain, which stops the transmission of pain signals. Sumatriptan works best as an abortive agent when injected into the skin and can be injected into the outside of the thigh or upper arm. Never inject sumatriptan into a vein or muscle.[15]A person’s doctor will demonstrate how to inject sumatriptan, and these injections are then safe to use independently, ideally at the first sign of a CH attack. Sumatriptan is most effective when used at the start of a CH attack. Doctors will recommend the appropriate dose and dosing schedule in each case.[16]It is also possible to use sumatriptan as a nasal spray, but this method of administration is considered to be significantly less effective at reducing CH symptoms than sumatriptan injections.Always inform a doctor if a person is on a course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) medication before taking sumatriptan. SSRIs increase the levels of serotonin in the brain, a property which sumatriptan shares. Using two serotonergic medications, agents which increase serotonin levels, simultaneously can lead to serotonin syndrome: an adverse reaction to having too much serotonin in the body.Recovery after a CH attackCH attacks can be physically exhausting. Although the pain of a cluster headache will alleviate after using an abortive agent, the affected person is likely to benefit from a period of recovery, which may involve resting, spending time in a calm, quiet room and drinking water to stay hydrated.If a person is likely to be affected by CH attacks at work, it is recommended that they inform their workplace, so that their employers understand the nature of the condition and can accommodate their needs. During a bout of CHs, these may include working from home or taking several breaks to manage attacks.[17]Long-term treatment for cluster headachesFor people who experience cluster headaches so frequently that they cannot manage the condition effectively using oxygen therapy or sumatriptan injections, additional treatments may be recommended. These include:[18][19]Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (TVNS): This treatment involves providing the affected person with a small, handheld device which they can use to treat CH attacks when they occur. The device can also be used in between attacks to reduce their frequency. The TVNS device works by emitting a low-voltage electrical current, which, when applied to the skin on the neck near the vagus nerve, will stimulate it, relieving tension and pain. However, TVNS can, in rare cases, cause a CH attack to develop, and this treatment option may therefore be unsuitable for some people.[20]
Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) stimulation: The sphenopalatine ganglion is a nerve bundle which is located behind the nose. In people affected by CHs, low-voltage electrical stimulation of of the SPG can relieve the pain of a CH attack. SPG stimulation requires the implantation of a device – which is smaller than an almond – into the side of the face.[21]General anaesthetic is used to implant the device, and a small incision is made in the upper gum on the side most affected by CHs. The implantation procedure takes around an hour, and there is no visible scarring. After implantation, people affected by CHs can activate the device to stimulate the SPG by using a handheld monitor when they feel an attack coming on. The SPG can also be stimulated between attacks to reduce their frequency.","The causes of cluster headaches are unknown, so it is not possible to prevent the development of the CHs disorder itself. However, smoking tobacco is a known cause of CHs, and giving up smoking may therefore reduce a person’s chances of developing them.People who are affected by CHs can take measures to prevent headache attacks, including avoiding triggers and making healthy lifestyle choices.Being aware of triggersKeeping a diary of the circumstances surrounding one’s CHs can help a person to identify any possible triggers of headache attacks within a bout of CHs. Logging one’s CHs can also potentially help to establish the overall triggers of CH bouts, such as seasonal changes.The affected person can then make lifestyle choices aimed at avoiding triggers, e.g. not wearing perfume in Spring and Fall, if their bouts of CHs generally occur during seasonal changes and strong smells are found to be a likely triggering factor.Good to know: Many known triggers of CHs only cause a person to develop a headache if they are experiencing a bout. During a period of remission, a person may be able to encounter these triggers – such a drinking alcohol in moderation or smelling a strong scent – without being struck by a CH.Preventative medicationsPreventative medications for CHs vary in effectiveness between people, and a person may need to try several different forms of medication to find the one that is right for them. A person may take preventative medication all year round in the case of chronic cluster headaches, or periodically to prevent headache attacks during a bout.[2]The first-line medication for preventing CHs is a type of medication regularly used in the treatment of high blood pressure, called a calcium channel blocker. In this case, it works to reduce vasoconstriction, which helps prevent CH attacks. These kinds of medications may cause heart problems to develop in some people, so a person’s heart will be monitored regularly, using an ECG machine when they are using this medication, to safeguard against this.[22]Other medications which may be prescribed to as preventative treatments for CHs include:[22][23]Corticosteroids: These medications are usually used in bursts of 2-3 weeks, generally to help break a cycle of CHs or in conjunction with other therapies that take longer to take effect. Due to the side-effects associated with long-term use, such as high blood sugar and the thinning of bones, these medications are suitable for short-term use only.
Greater optical nerve block: This treatment involves injecting an anaesthetic and steroid medication into the nerves that supply the scalp, at the back of the head. It is carried out in hospital by a doctor and can bring about periods of remission in people with CH disorder lasting a month or more. The procedure takes around a minute to perform and can be repeated every two months.
Lithium carbonate: Most often prescribed to treat chronic cluster headaches, this oral medication can help to re-regulate hormonal imbalances within the brain, reducing the frequency of CH attacks. However, use of this medication must be accompanied by regular blood tests to measure the levels of lithium in the blood. Having elevated levels of lithium for prolonged periods can cause problems such as kidney damage. Problems such as this can be avoided with close medical supervision.[24]
Anticonvulsant medication: These kinds of medication have been found to be effective in inducing periods of remission in people affected by CHs and in reducing the frequency of attacks when taken long-term. It is taken orally, and the dosage is usually increased over time at the discretion of a person’s doctor.[25]Doctors will help to decide on the preventative medication(s) that are most suitable for each person, according to their pattern of CH bouts and general health.Making healthy lifestyle choicesAlthough medical treatments are usually needed in order to bring cluster headache disorder under control, many people who are affected by CHs find that making certain changes to their lifestyle can help them in managing the condition and can reduce the frequency of headache attacks. These include:Relaxation: Practicing relaxation skills such as yoga and deep breathing can help to diffuse stress and aid muscle relaxation. Setting aside periods of the day for relaxation and taking regular breaks from activities which involve sitting or standing in the same position can help to diffuse the buildups of muscle and nerve tension that contribute to CHs.
Resting well: Getting eight hours of sleep a night and going to bed at the same time each day can help to reduce stress, which can reduce the frequency of CHs.
Exercising regularly: Exercise releases beta-endorphins in the body, which can relieve stress. Exercising for 20 minutes, three times per week, can help to decrease the frequency of CHs and the severity of individual attacks.
Staying hydrated: Drinking eight glasses of water or other non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated beverages per day can help. For people who are affected by chronic or persistent CHs, opting for non-alcoholic beverages instead of drinks containing alcohol all year round can help to prevent CHs. Cutting down on, or cutting out, caffeine, can also help prevent CHs.
Seeking help to quit using tobacco products: The likelihood of being affected by CHs is greater among people who consume tobacco products than those who do not. In people with CHs, quitting is recommended. Doctors will be able to provide a range of resources on quitting smoking and connect a person to support programmes suited to their needs.","Q: What are the key differences between a cluster headache and a migraine?
A: Cluster headaches are unilateral (affecting one side of the head). This is one of the principal factors which distinguish CHs from migraines. Migraines involve a more generalized pain and typically affect both sides of the head at once. Additionally, the duration of a migraine is usually much longer than that of a CH, up to 72 hours.[26] People affected by a migraine tend to want to sit or lie down, whereas a person experiencing a CH is prone to agitated movement. See this resource on migraine headaches for more information.Q: Are any home remedies or natural products effective at treating CHs?
A: The two most popular natural remedies for cluster headaches are:Melatonin: Taking supplements of melatonin, a hormone found naturally in the body which helps regulate sleep cycles, has been found to help reduce the frequency of cluster headache attacks.[27]
Capsaicin: Using a nasal spray or cream containing capsaicin, a compound with anti-inflammatory properties, found in hot peppers, has been found to help reduce the frequency of cluster headache attacks.[28]Not much clinical research has been carried out to establish the efficacy of either treatment in comparison to conventional treatments for cluster headache relief, such as suboptical steroid injections. In the evidence-based guidelines on treatments for cluster headaches devised by the American Headache Society, melatonin supplements are rated at grade C, i.e. possibly, rather than probably or certainly, helpful as a treatment for CHs, and intranasally applied capsaicin is rated at grade U, meaning that there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation.[29]If a person wishes to incorporate natural remedies such as these into their treatment plan for CHs, they should consult a doctor before choosing products or beginning to use them. These treatments may not be suitable for everyone. Furthermore, some natural products may contain ingredients which do not combine safely with other treatments or medications."
Colorectal Cancer,https://ada.com/conditions/colorectal-cancer/,,"Symptoms of colorectal cancer may include a change in bowel habits, pain in the lower abdomen, blood in stool, unexpected weight loss and a feeling of tiredness and difficulty performing everyday tasks. Many people with colorectal cancer do not have symptoms in the early stages, so screening (testing people without symptoms) is important.",[],The diagnosis of colorectal cancer can be made when a person develops suspicious symptoms or during screening (testing someone without symptoms). Testing for colorectal cancer involves testing the stool for small amounts of blood (called a fecal occult blood test) or via colonoscopy (a camera inserted through the anus to look at the bowel). The colonoscopy also allows for taking samples for further investigation if a growth is found. A CT scan (computed tomography scan) may also be done to stage the cancer.,"The treatment of colorectal cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, colorectal cancer can be treated by radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy, or a combination of therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment. People who have had bowel cancer may benefit taking part in a support group or counseling program, especially while undergoing treatment.","Screening in important in preventing the diagnosis of colorectal cancer in the later stages. People who have a family member with colorectal cancer should ask their doctor about bowel cancer screening, as in some cases, these people begin screening at a younger age. Cutting back on red meat and increasing fiber in the diet may help to prevent some episodes of colorectal cancer. Losing weight, giving up smoking and reducing alcohol intake may also help to prevent colorectal cancer.",[]

Colostomy Bag,https://ada.com/colostomy-bag/,,[],[],[],[],[],"Q: After surgery for Crohn’s disease, will a pouch be needed permanently?
A: Not usually. The type of surgery which is usually recommended in Crohn’s disease is called a resection.[12] Doctors will consider performing a resection to remove the sections of the intestine which are inflamed, or damaged by inflammation. A resection of the intestine is carried out in cases where the symptoms of Crohn’s disease have not been alleviated by other treatments. When the inflamed sections of the intestine have been removed, the healthy sections will be stitched together. A resection is a major procedure and usually performed under general anaesthetic.In people with Crohn’s disease who have undergone a resection, ileostomy may be prescribed, to divert stool and other digestive waste away from the colon to give the area of the intestine, which has undergone a resection, a chance to heal. Whether this is temporary or permanent depends on the nature of a person’s Crohn’s disease, their post-surgery recovery and their overall medical history. Even if doctors do not recommend reversal and it is decided that the best management plan involves a person using their continence pouch on a permanent basis, many people find that they experience a greatly improved quality of life with the pouch, compared to their previous experiences of managing Crohn’s disease.[13]However, the type of surgery usually prescribed to treat Crohn’s disease is a loop form of the procedure, which is temporary. Most people with Crohn’s disease who have undergone this procedure will be able to have it reversed following successful healing. They will excrete waste via the rectum and anus as normal thereafter. See this resource for more information about Crohn’s disease.Q: How can I learn to be comfortable with the idea that using a colostomy bag will be part of my life on a long-term or permanent basis?
A: There are many support groups, online and in real life, that exist specifically to help people, who are new to using a colostomy bag, adjust to the lifestyle changes that it necessitates. Social networks that help people connect with others who use colostomy bags are specifically designed for sharing tips and techniques to help people overcome any misgivings that they may have and to promote awareness that it is possible to live a normal, happy life after a temporary of permanent colostomy.Dedicated websites and forums, such as More Than Your Bag, Coloplast and Living with a Stoma encourage people with all types of colostomy bags to share success stories. These personal narratives are intended to inspire others to feel positive about the improvements that their colostomy and use of a colostomy bag have brought to their health, rather than feeling disappointed about needing to use one.Furthermore, over the past few decades, an increasing number of celebrities with colostomy bags and ostomies have spoken out about their usefulness.[14] This has further helped to normalize the idea that a person may require colostomy surgery during their lifetime. Furthermore, these stories help to show that everybody who undergoes a colostomy can go on to use their bag without problems and with a positive mindset, embracing the freedoms it offers.Q: What is a colonoscopy bag?
A: There is no such thing as a colonoscopy bag, but it is very understandable to get confused, because colostomy and colonoscopy are such similar-sounding words. However, the definitions of these two procedures and their outcomes are very different. Simply put:A colonoscopy is a scanning procedure, in which a thin flexible tube with a camera on its end is inserted into the bowel via the anus and rectum. The only function of a colonoscopy is to provide images of the inside of the bowel; no changes to the body are made.
A colostomy is a surgical procedure in which an ostomy is created to provide an alternative means for waste to exit the body, temporarily or permanently. After a person has undergone a colostomy to create their ostomy, they will need to collect waste using a colostomy bag.Situations in which a person may undergo a colonoscopy include:Diagnosis: Doctors may wish to see the inside of the bowel in order to find out more about what might be causing a person’s symptoms.
Before surgery: It is standard practice for surgeons to perform a colonoscopy in the run-up to many kinds of colorectal surgery. People who undergo a colostomy very often have a colonoscopy beforehand.See this resource for more information on preparing for a colonoscopy, and, for information about the variety of conditions that can be diagnosed with the aid of a colonoscopy, download the Ada app.Q: Is it safe to wear a colostomy bag during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan?
A: Yes, in some cases. When undergoing an MRI scan, it may not be possible to wear certain types of bag and flange which use magnets in their mechanism of attachment. This is because bringing magnets into the scanner can disrupt the imaging process and, furthermore, can compromise the magnetism of the device. However, it will be possible to check with your doctor and the radiology team  in advance of the scan whether your colostomy appliances are suitable.People who use a colostomy bag and who are undergoing a CT scan with the use of contrast material should inform the person who will be performing the scan in advance. See this resource for more information about contrast material and undergoing a CT scanFor all types of imaging scan, people who use a colostomy bag, are encouraged to bring spare supplies with them on the day of the scan in case a fresh bag is required.Q: What is a colostomy bag cover?
A: Feeling positive about the way that your colostomy bag looks is a key means of eliminating any negative impact it may initially have on your lifestyle or choice of activities. There are many companies which make attractive covers for colostomy bags out of different materials, and it is possible to order covers that are custom-made from the material of your choice.Covers can be useful in situations such as going exercising or to the beach. If you would prefer not to display the bag itself, which may be visible in swimwear or sportswear, wearing a cover removes the need to wear extra clothing for this purpose.Many outlets specialize in colostomy bag covers for specific types of activity, for example, purpose-built swimwear or underwear-style covers for intimate occasions. These can easily be purchased online. It is also possible to make colostomy bag covers oneself, using a sewing pattern to ensure accurate sizing."
Common Cold,https://ada.com/conditions/common-cold/,,"The symptoms of a cold tend to develop quickly, usually within a few days of an individual becoming infected.The most commonly experienced symptoms of a cold include:[2]Coughing
Sneezing
A sore throat
A runny or blocked nose
A hoarse voice
Malaise ( a feeling of general discomfort and illness, which should to be confused with general fatigue)Less common symptoms of a cold include:Fever (37-39 C / 98.6-102.2 F)
Headache
Earache
A feeling of pressure in the ears and face
Muscle painThe symptoms of a cold will usually begin to fade within a few days and clear up completely after roughly a week to 10 days. Colds will generally last longer (10-14 days) in children under five years old.When to see a doctor?In most cases, a cold will  not require visiting a doctor. However, medical attention should be sought in the following cases:Symptoms do not disappear after three-weeks
Symptoms suddenly worsen
Breathing becomes difficult","There is a large range of viruses that can cause a cold. Most colds are caused by a group of viruses known as rhinoviruses, of which there are over a 100 different types.[3]After having a cold, an individual becomes immune to that particular virus strain. However, due to the large amount of cold-causing viruses, individuals still experience an average of two to three colds per year. As children tend to spend a large amount of time in close contact with other children and are less aware of the methods of preventing a cold, they are prone to experiencing an average of 8-12 colds per year.Colds are normally spread through hand-to-hand contact and less commonly through coughing, sneezing or touching a surface that has been exposed to the virus.","Most people will be able to self-diagnose a cold through recognition of the symptoms being experienced. This will also be the case if a doctor is consulted, though this will not be necessary in most cases. If a complication is suspected, various tests may be ordered (such as an X-ray).","A cold will typically remedy itself in up to 10 days. During this time, the symptoms of a cold can be managed through a combination of self-care techniques and over-the-counter medications. These methods, however, will not shorten the duration of the cold.[4]Self careTo help manage the symptoms of a cold, the following things may be effective:Adequate fluid intake
Getting plenty of rest
Eating healthily (a diet high in fibre, fruit and vegetables is recommended)
Stopping smokingOver-the-counter medicationsThe following medications are generally available from a pharmacy without requiring a prescription. The information leaflet that accompanies the product should always be read before use and their guidelines should be followed.[5]Painkillers:  Ibuprofen and paracetamol may be effective for the relief of a fever and as general pain relief. Children may be given painkillers, though age-appropriate versions (usually available from pharmacies) are generally advised. Children should never be given paracetamol and ibuprofen at the same time. Some people prefer  to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) medications such as aspirin to help relieve the symptoms of a cold. Under no circumstances should a child (12 years or younger) be given these medications.
Decongestants: Oral or spray decongestants may be effective in relieving a runny or blocked nose and help ease breathing problems. They should not be taken by children under 6, and only on the advise of a doctor in children under 12. The effects of decongestants only last for a short period and should not be used for over a week.
Cold medicines: All-in-one cold medicines generally include a combination of painkillers and decongestants, making them effective at relieving a variety of cold symptoms. Generally, these medicines should not be taken in combination with any other medication.
Lozenges: Oral lozenges help to lubricate the lining of the throat, making them effective at relieving a sore throat.
Vapor rubs: Applied to the chest and back, vapor rubs can help a child breathe more easily. Although less commonly used, they may also be effective for adults.","The viruses that cause colds are typically spread through the tiny droplets released when someone with a cold coughs or sneezes. This may happen when a person inhales these droplets after they have been released into the air, or, more typically, through skin-to-skin contact with an infected person (droplets are most likely to be present on the hands) or through contact with a contaminated surface or object.[9]To help prevent the development of a cold, the following measures are advised:[10]Keeping the hands clean by washing them often with soap and water
Avoiding unnecessary touching of the eyes, nose and mouth
Staying away from people with a coldPeople who already have a cold should avoid spreading the virus by taking the following steps:Staying home from work or school
Avoiding close contact with others (shaking hands, kissing, etc)
Completely covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing
Washing the hands after coughing or sneezing","Q: Do I have a common cold or flu?
A: Although the common cold shares symptoms with flu, it is, in fact, a far more serious condition and not merely a severe cold. As with a cold, a person with  flu may experience symptoms such as coughing, sneezing and a sore throat, but they are also much more likely to experience fever, fatigue and muscle aches. Flu symptoms also typically appear more suddenly and disappear after around a week. If symptoms persist for longer than this or are particularly severe, medical attention should be sought.[11]Q: Is there a cure for the common cold?
A: No, there is currently no cure for the common cold. However, a cold will in most cases disappear naturally and its symptoms can be managed through a combination of self-care (drinking fluids, resting, etc) and medication (painkillers, decongestants, etc). As a cold is viral in nature, antibiotics are ineffective.Q: What is the typical duration of a common cold?
A: In adults, colds tend to last for an average of 7 to 10 days. Children may have a cold for slightly longer, with it normally lasting for up to two weeks. If a cold persists for over three weeks, medical attention should be sought.Q: What is the incubation period for a common cold?
A: The typical incubation period for a cold is 24 to 72 hours. After this, symptoms will begin to develop.[12]"
Common Warts,https://ada.com/conditions/common-warts/,,"Common warts are easy to recognise and differentiate from other warts, such as genital, filiform or plantar warts. They typically appear on the hands or fingers, though can appear in any non-genital location. They are generally:[2]Small, raised skin growths
Oval or round in shape
Rough to the touch
Hard around the edges and softer in the middle
Speckled with small black dotsMedical attention should be sought if:[3]Warts cause pain or change colour
Warts spread, do not respond to treatment or frequently recur
An individual has a weakened immune system
There is uncertainty as to whether the growths are common warts or a different condition","Common warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are over a hundred different types of HPV, each affecting one or several different areas of the body.HPV infects the skin through small cuts, scrapes or weak spots, with the virus incubating for approximately two to six months before developing into warts. It causes the protein keratin to develop in excess on the surface of the skin.[4][5]Common warts are particularly prevalent in children and young adults, as well as those with weakened immune systems as a result of conditions such as HIV/AIDS or organ transplantation.[4]HPV is contagious and is passed on through direct skin-to-skin contact or indirect contact with objects or surfaces. Damaged or wet skin is most likely to pick up the virus, meaning locations such as swimming pools are particularly conducive to infection.[6]","In the majority of cases, a doctor or dermatologist will be able to diagnose common warts through a simple physical examination. If further confirmation is needed, a skin biopsy may be ordered. To do this, the top layer of a wart will be scraped off and sent to a laboratory for testing. This is a straightforward and minimally invasive procedure.[7]","Common warts will often disappear without treatment, especially in childhood. However, common warts can also be persistent and last for a significant amount of time. They can also be painful and unsightly, especially when they form in clusters. In these cases, treatment options are available.[8]These treatment options may be used in conjunction with home treatment options, or when home treatment options have failed to remedy the condition. The method chosen by the doctor or dermatologist will depend on the severity of the warts, the symptoms and the general health of the individual.[9]Salicylic acid: This is a common method for treating warts. Salicylic acid works by gradually dissolving layers of the wart tissue, eventually resulting in total removal. It is generally applied to the wart as a gel or liquid. Though salicylic acid is also available in over-the-counter products, prescription varieties are typically stronger and more effective. Along with peeling away the surface of the warts, salicylic acid may also encourage the body’s immune system to combat the virus.
Cryotherapy: Generally performed by a doctor or dermatologist, cryotherapy is a method of freezing warts using liquid nitrogen. After around a week, the resulting dead tissue can be sloughed off. Repeated cryotherapy sessions may be necessary.If these options are ineffective, other, less common treatment methods may be used. These include:[10]Trichloroacetic acid: This is a strong acid applied by a doctor or dermatologist to the warts.[11]
Immunotherapy: Individuals are given antigens which encourage the body’s immune system to fight the wart itself. This treatment is generally reserved for those with recurring common warts.[12]
Electrosurgery: This method involves burning away the wart tissue using a specially designed heated needle. A local anesthetic will usually be required to numb the pain, and scarring is possible.
Laser treatment: A laser is used to burn off the skin tissue and remove the wart. It is generally considered to be a last resort option due to the likelihood of scarring and the extended recovery time.[13]","It can be difficult to fully avoid contracting common warts, with most people experiencing them at some point in their life. However, certain preventative measures can help reduce the risk:[16]Avoid contact with other people’s warts
Avoid contact with clothing, objects or surfaces that may be carrying the virus
The HPV vaccine may reduce the risk of contracting the virus and developing common warts, though this is not guaranteed and may be most effective when received at a young age[17]If a person already has warts, they should take steps to avoid spreading the virus to other areas of the body. They can:Avoid unnecessarily touching or scratching the warts
Cover warts with a plaster, especially when swimming
Wash the hands regularly, especially after contact with the warts
Avoid sharing towels and clothing","Q: Should I be concerned about common warts during pregnancy?
A: No, infection with HPV should not pose any risk to your baby. As in any case of common warts, no treatment may be necessary, though options are available over the counter and from doctors.[18]Q: Are common warts contagious?
A: The virus that causes common warts, human papillomavirus (HPV), is contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of contracting HPV, which can be passed on through skin-to-skin contact or through contact with an object or surface carrying the virus. The risk of contracting HPV is especially high in warm, wet conditions, such as those found at a swimming pool or in a locker room.[19]Q: What is the difference between common warts and plantar warts?
A: Both common warts and plantar warts are a product of human papillomavirus (HPV). Unlike plantar warts, however, common warts may develop anywhere on the body, though most typically grow on the hands and fingers. Plantar warts are found on the feet only.[20]"
Concussion Syndrome,https://ada.com/conditions/concussion-syndrome/,,"The main symptoms of concussion are blurred vision (or seeing double), a headache, loss of balance, confusion and memory problems. Some people may lose consciousness for a short time. People may also feel nauseous or dizzy. Concussion sometimes causes mood and behavioral changes, and may make people irritable or apathetic. People who have worsening confusion, who become drowsy or lose consciousness, who vomit repeatedly, who develop a discharge from their nose or black eyes may have a more serious head injury. Anyone displaying these symptoms needs urgent review by a doctor.",[],"The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and a examination of the nervous system. If the head injury was severe, a computed tomography scan (CT scan) or a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI scan) may be needed to exclude a severe brain injury.",There is no specific treatment for this condition. People who have had a concussion should rest until their symptoms have settled. Paracetamol may be helpful for headache. Athletes who have had a concussion should get advice from a doctor before returning to contact sports.,Wearing a helmet or head guard while participating in sports with a high risk of concussion may help to prevent some cases.,[]
Congenital Hypothyroidism,https://ada.com/conditions/congenital-hypothyroidism/,,"Most newborn babies with congenital hypothyroidism show no obvious signs of the condition.[5] This may be because they receive some of their parent’s thyroid hormone before being delivered. They may also be able to produce a small amount of their own.[1][8]However, some babies affected by congenital hypothyroidism may be less active, sleep a lot and be difficult to feed.[6][9] If congenital hypothyroidism is severe, the following signs and symptoms may also be present:[1][2][5][9]Weak cry
Poor feeding
Constipation
Dry skin
Poor muscle tone (floppiness)
Cold hands and feet; they may also be mottled
Prolonged jaundice (yellow skin)
Puffy face
Large tongue
Swollen stomach
Umbilical hernia
Large fontanelles (the soft spots on a baby’s head)It is important that a newborn baby be screened for congenital hypothyroidism as early as possible in order to prevent complications.In many countries, babies are screened sufficiently soon after birth that they will generally not have symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism. However, in rare cases, a baby with the condition may have symptoms immediately after birth.[5]In parts of the world where screening is not performed, a baby may not show symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism initially, but they will typically develop symptoms in the first few months after birth.[5]","The most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism is the baby’s thyroid gland not developing properly. The gland may be absent, smaller than normal, or positioned in the wrong part of the neck. It is not known why this happens, but the malformation is not usually inherited – meaning that any siblings are unlikely to be born with the same thyroid condition.[2][3]Other less-common causes of congenital hypothyroidism include:[1][2][3]Problems metabolizing thyroid hormone; this may be inherited
Problems with the hypothalamus or pituitary gland
Iodine deficiency in the parent during pregnancy, though this is uncommon in developed countries
Thyroid antibodies in the parent during pregnancy
Anti-thyroid medication taken during pregnancy (in a small number of cases)Excessive iodine intake, congenital liver hemangiomas (non-cancerous growths of blood vessels) and certain gene mutations may also be factors in the development of congenital hypothyroidism.[10]","In many countries, all newborn babies are screened for congenital hypothyroidism, shortly after birth. This is done in hospital using a pinprick test that draws a small amount of blood, usually from the baby’s heel, to check their thyroid hormone levels. The baby will typically be checked for other conditions like cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease at the same time.[1]If the baby’s thyroid hormone levels are not within the acceptable range, a doctor will order further blood tests to confirm the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism. They may also request a thyroid ultrasound to be performed in order to assess the physical status of the thyroid gland. Treatment will be started immediately.[1][2]","Treatment for congenital hypothyroidism typically involves medication, monitoring and assessment of the baby’s development.[3]MedicationThe standard treatment for congenital hypothyroidism is the prescription of synthetic thyroid hormone in the form of levothyroxine (L-T4). In many cases, it will be necessary to take levothyroxine for life.[2][9]Levothyroxine comes in tablets, which should be crushed and given to the baby in a small amount of water or milk every day. A doctor will advise on the dose needed, as well as what foods to avoid giving the baby before and after taking the medication. It is important not to mix the tablets with soy formula or any preparation containing concentrated iron or calcium. When the child is older, they can swallow the tablets on their own with a cup of water. The dose will need to be adjusted as the child grows up.[5][9]Prompt, proper treatment with levothyroxine can generally prevent complications from congenital hypothyroidism. The medication is generally considered safe and has no side-effects at the correct dose. If the dose is too low, symptoms of hypothyroidism may develop, while too high a dose can lead to symptoms of hyperthyroidism.[3]MonitoringIn many cases, a doctor will recommend working with a pediatric endocrinologist (a specialist in childhood conditions related to hormones) to help manage the baby’s congenital hypothyroidism as they grow up.[2][3][9]The baby will need to have regular medical check-ups to make sure that their thyroid hormone levels are adequate for healthy growth and development. Regular blood tests will also be required. Until the baby is one year old, tests will usually be necessary every one to three months or more frequently. Thereafter, it may be possible to reduce the frequency of blood tests. A doctor will adjust the dose of levothyroxine as needed.[3][9]Developmental assessmentA doctor will also monitor the height, weight and overall growth and development of the child.[3] They will periodically assess the child’s language and communication skills, motor ability and behavior.[1] If it seems necessary, a doctor may recommend having the child’s development formally evaluated. Should there be any delays in speech or learning, an early intervention program can be arranged to assist the child.[3]","It is generally not possible to prevent congenital hypothyroidism.[9] However, pregnant people with a history of thyroid conditions, as well as those taking any medications or supplements, are advised to consult with medical practitioners before, during and after pregnancy in the interests of optimal health management.","Q: Will a baby with congenital hypothyroidism grow up normally?
A: If a baby with congenital hypothyroidism is diagnosed and treated promptly and correctly, the prognosis is excellent. The child has a good chance of leading a normal, healthy life. If diagnosis and treatment is delayed, however, serious developmental problems may occur.[1][2][3][9]In babies with severe congenital hypothyroidism, it is possible that there may be long-term neurocognitive (mental) effects. If treatment is not started promptly or the dosage or administering of levothyroxine is incorrect, the child may experience developmental delays.[3][8][9]Q: Is levothyroxine safe for babies?
A: Yes. Levothyroxine is a synthetic version of the thyroid hormone produced by healthy thyroid glands. It is very effective and is considered safe to take every day, for babies, children and adults with hypothyroidism. However, it is important to check the baby’s thyroid levels regularly and adjust the dose of levothyroxine as needed, as too much levothyroxine can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism, while too little can lead to symptoms of hypothyroidism.[9]Q: Does congenital hypothyroidism run in families?
A: In a small number of cases, congenital hypothyroidism is caused by an inherited condition. In these instances, the thyroid gland itself typically appears to be healthy, but there is a problem with the production of thyroid hormone. If a doctor suspects an hereditary condition, they may refer the baby and parents to a specialist in genetics to confirm the diagnosis and advise on future family planning.[3]"
Conjunctivitis,https://ada.com/conditions/conjunctivitis/,,[],[],"If symptoms are mild, a diagnosis of conjunctivitis can generally be made without seeing a doctor, and the condition can be managed at home. However, if there is any uncertainty or concern over the condition, or the symptoms seem severe, seeing a doctor is very important.A doctor will take the person’s medical history and examine their eyes to determine whether conjunctivitis is present, and if so, what type of conjunctivitis it is. They will rule out other eye conditions like dry eye syndrome and more serious concerns such as uveitis and keratitis, which is an inflammation of the cornea, the front part of the eye. In some cases, laboratory tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.[1][3][5]","In many cases, conjunctivitis in adults and children will clear up on its own, without specific treatment. To relieve discomfort, the following home remedies and over-the-counter treatments may be helpful:[1][3][4][16][17]Gently wiping discharge from the eye with a clean cloth, sterile pad or cotton wool soaked in water
Applying lubricating eye drops, called artificial tears, which are available without a prescription, to the eye
Applying a cold or warm compress – a clean cloth that has been soaked in water – to the eye
Avoiding rubbing the eyes, as this may aggravate symptoms
Avoiding the use of contact lenses and makeup until the conjunctivitis has cleared
In the case of allergic conjunctivitis, avoiding exposure to the allergen, e.g. dustIn serious cases of conjunctivitis, prescription eye drops and other medicine, such as antihistamine tablets – for allergic conjunctivitis, antibiotics – for bacterial conjunctivitis, and antiviral medication – for viral conjunctivitis, may be recommended. Sometimes, a person will be referred to an eye specialist, an ophthalmologist, for treatment.",[],[]
Contact Dermatitis,https://ada.com/conditions/contact-dermatitis/,,"The symptoms of contact dermatitis occur on the part of the skin that has come into contact with the cause of the irritation. This is often the hands, face or areas of skin that have contact with clothing or jewellery.Typical symptoms of contact dermatitis include:Swelling
Itchy skin
A red, blotchy rash
Dry and scaly skin
Fluid-filled blisters","There are two types of contact dermatitis: irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. Of these, irritant contact dermatitis is the most common, accounting for roughly 80 percent of all cases.[1]Irritant contact dermatitis occurs when the skin comes into contact with a substance that irritates the skin. Irritants come in many forms, and may include:[3]Prolonged exposure to water can cause skin irritation, especially if the water contains chlorine or is hard or chalky
Detergents, such as washing-up liquid, soap or bleach
Solvents, such as oil, petrol or chemicals found in the workplace
Acids and alkalis
Dust, soil and powders
Certain plants, such as clematis, hellebore and poison ivyThe condition may develop following a single exposure to a very strong irritant, or develop from frequent exposure to a weaker irritant.Allergic contact dermatitis occurs when the skin comes into contact with a specific substance which triggers an allergic reaction, known as an allergen. The allergen can be something the skin has newly been exposed to or something it has been exposed to many times before. Why some people develop allergic contact dermatitis and some do not is not entirely clear.[1][3]A wide array of substances can cause an allergic reaction, though some of the most common include:[3]Nickel, a substance common in metal alloys used in everyday items such as jewellery, clothes and bra straps
Cobalt, a metal sometimes found in jewellery
Chromate, a metal sometimes found in cement
Cosmetics, such as perfumes, hair dyes and nail varnish","Irritant contact dermatitis is diagnosed according to the person’s history of exposure to irritants and through an inspection of the symptomatic area of the skin.To diagnose allergic contact dermatitis, in addition to an examination of the affected area, a patch test will be carried out. This involves applying small patches containing common allergens to the skin, typically on the back, leaving them for a set amount of time – normally around two days – and then inspecting the results for signs of dermatitis. Following this, the dermatologist will be able to identify which allergen is responsible for the reaction.[4]","Treating contact dermatitis will typically involve moisturizers, topical corticosteroids and/or steroid tablets. A dermatologist will be able to advise on the best course of treatment for each person.[5]Moisturizers are often useful in the treatment of dry and scaly skin. A variety of different emollients are available – a dermatologist will be able to offer advice on which type is most suitable.[5]Topical corticosteroids are steroid-containing creams and ointments that are applied directly to the affected skin. They can be effective in treating the redness and pain of dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are available in a range of strengths, with the appropriate strength dependent on the severity and location of the dermatitis.[5]In severe cases, particularly when the dermatitis covers a large area of skin, steroid tablets may be prescribed.[5] Always follow the instructions provided by the doctor when taking this kind of medication.In mild cases, home remedies such as cool baths or cool, wet compresses may be effective in soothing the symptoms of contact dermatitis.","Avoiding contact with the irritant or allergen that is causing contact dermatitis is the most effective way of preventing the condition. If total avoidance is not possible, creating a barrier between the substance and the skin – by wearing gloves, for example – is recommended. Carrying out a patch test before using new cosmetics or detergents, and using barrier creams may also help to prevent the onset of contact dermatitis.",[]
Conversion Disorder,https://ada.com/conditions/conversion-disorder/,,"People with conversion disorder may experience symptoms such as:[2][3][4]Blindness
Double vision
Weakness or paralysis
Muscular spasms
Seizures
Loss of balance
Trouble coordinating movements (ataxia)
Numb skin or tingling limbs
Loss of sensation in limbs
Memory loss
Unresponsiveness
Deafness
Difficulty swallowing
Inability to speak (aphonia)
Loss of sense of smell (anosmia)
Motor tics
Hallucinations
False pregnancySymptoms may begin without warning and can be debilitating. Episodes are typically short in duration, usually lasting days or weeks, though the experience varies from person to person.Up to 25 percent of people with conversion disorder may experience a recurrence of symptoms or develop new symptoms in the future.[5]","Conversion disorder is believed to be an expression of psychologically stressful experiences. While many people experience physical changes related to their mindset, such as a racing heart when feeling nervous, people with conversion disorder tend to experience more dramatic symptoms when faced with psychological and emotional stress.Examples of such emotions causing physical symptoms in people experiencing conversion disorder include:A person suppressing anger and the desire to hit someone may experience numbness, tingling or paralysis of the arm
A person with a past history of traumatic experiences may experience seizures and loss of consciousness, due to suppressing memories of their experience(s)Conversion disorder is classified in the DSM-5[6] as a somatic symptom disorder, the symptoms of which were formerly known collectively as somatoform disorders. Somatization is a process in which psychological distress is converted into physical symptoms. Although there may be no medical or physical cause found to explain them, the symptoms are real, and affected people are encouraged to seek medical attention.","Diagnosis is made by an experienced doctor or psychiatrist, based on based on discussions with the affected person about their life, feelings, and the history of their symptoms. It can be difficult to diagnose conversion disorder, and multiple tests are often performed to exclude other causes for the symptoms. A diagnosis is usually reached by process of elimination.Tests are likely to concentrate on possible other causes for the neurological symptoms. One sign that a person has conversion disorder may be that symptoms differ from those of neurologic conditions. Key indicators that a person may be affected by conversion disorder, rather than a neurologic condition include:[3]The presence of physical symptoms that would need to involve multiple parts of the nervous system
Assessment revealing that a person’s responses differ from those typically associated with neurologic conditionsWhen no physical cause can be found for the symptoms, and there is a known cause of stress, a diagnosis of conversion disorder may be reached. Physical symptoms must also cause significant distress, and impact the person’s daily life, in order for a diagnosis of conversion disorder to be made.[7]","Diagnosing conversion disorder, and developing a trusted relationship between health practitioner and the person with the condition, is an important first step in treatment. That relationship can be used to begin education about the condition and counseling to address the cause of the stress.[8]Reassurance that symptoms are not caused by a serious underlying condition may also go some way to easing them. If the person with conversion disorder is also suffering from anxiety or depression, this can be addressed as part of the treatment for conversion disorder and often helps to improve the symptoms.Treatments that can be recommended for conversion disorder include:[2][3]Psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or counselling
Hypnosis
Physical therapy
Occupational therapyPracticing stress-relieving techniques, such as regular light exercise and enjoyable activities, such as gardening, can be helpful in preventing the symptoms of conversion disorder. It is also helpful to have a reliable source of emotional support during times of stress.Prognosis of conversion disorderPeople affected by conversion disorder generally make a full recovery.. Even without treatment, symptoms are generally of short duration, usually lasting a few days to a few weeks, and often resolve themselves. However, without treatment, recurrences are common. Treatment can provide reassurance and support during times when symptoms occur, and may help to identify and address the underlying psychological cause for the condition.",[],"Q: Is conversion disorder a disability?
A: The United States Social Security Administration does recognize somatic symptom and related disorders as a disability. However, the qualifying criteria are quite stringent, and are based on detailed evidence of the disorder in a person’s medical profile, as well as its functional impact on their ability to go about their daily routine."
Coronary Artery Disease,https://ada.com/conditions/coronary-artery-disease/,,"Symptoms of coronary artery disease include angina (short-lived episodes of chest pain) and shortness of breath. Angina is usually brought on by exercise, and gets better with rest. Some people may experience angina whilst resting. The chest pain is often in the center of the chest, and may spread to the arm and jaw. Some people might also have nausea, a cold sweat, dizziness or fainting spells.",[],"Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and physical examination. An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) may show signs of heart muscle damage, and an exercising ECG/EKG may show heart damage that only occurs when exercising. Blood tests for cholesterol levels and blood sugar levels can also be helpful. Cardiac angiography, where dye is injected into the heart blood vessels and x-rays are taken, may help identify areas of narrowing or blockage in the heart arteries. Rarely, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) can be performed on the heart to examine the vessels.","Treatment depends on the specific symptoms and their severity. For people with mild, predictable chest pain symptoms, treatment involves thinning the blood to prevent blockages, and taking a medication to help open up the blood vessels when there is pain present. As the condition progresses, it might be necessary to have cardiac catheterization (insertion of a tube through the leg blood vessels into the heart blood vessels) to widen narrowed or blocked blood vessels with a stent (a small wire cage). Eventually, some people may need bypass surgery.","Preventing coronary artery disease involves lifestyle and diet changes. Being physically active, losing weight, ceasing to smoke and excluding alcohol from the diet can all help. Good management of other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol levels also help prevent the progression of coronary artery disease.",[]
Cradle Cap,https://ada.com/conditions/cradle-cap/,,"Cradle cap usually occurs on the parts of the body that have the highest density of sebaceous glands, such as:[1][2]The scalp
The face, around the nose, chin and mouth
The forehead, the back of the ears or the back of the neck
In other skin folds, for example in the armpits, inner elbows and backs of the knees
The buttocks and gluteal cleft (the diaper area)Cradle cap usually manifests as an oily, flaky crust on the baby’s scalp. However, the appearance of cradle cap can vary. It may also present as:[1][2][3]Mild, patchy scales
Extensive, thick scaly patches
Thick, oily yellow scales
Brown crusting patches
Red skin surrounded by pink patches - more common in skin folds
Swollen areas of skin - more common in skin folds.Cradle cap is not the result of an infection and should not feel hot to the touch, itch, smell or weep fluids. If the infant’s rash itches, feels warm, smells bad or weeps fluids, infection may have occurred,[1] and medical help should be sought.Cradle cap is most common in babies younger than six months of age and often appears within the first few weeks of life. It does not usually persist once the baby is older than nine months of age. In older children, symptoms resembling those of cradle cap may instead suggest:[4]Atopic dermatitis
Impetigo
Psoriasis
Contact dermatitis
RingwormGood to know: Atopic and contact dermatitis, impetigo, psoriasis and ringworm, which are also common skin conditions in babies and young children, can be easily distinguished from cradle cap as they are all itchy. Cradle cap is not usually itchy unless it is very severe.Cradle cap can spread to the diaper area, but diaper rash is a separate condition, which manifests as irritated, tender and red skin. This is caused by the infant’s skin coming into contact with a diaper that is soiled by urine or feces.[6] Babies with diaper rash tend to be irritable because of the discomfort.[7] For more information, see this resource on diaper rash.",[],[],"Mild cradle cap can be treated with easily available remedies like petroleum jelly, baby shampoo, almond or olive oil, baby oil and coal tar shampoo. In most cases, monitoring and home remedies suffice. However, if the rash bleeds, weeps fluid, is hot to the touch or spreads extensively, the infant should be taken to the doctor. More severe cases respond well to:[8]Topical steroids such as hydrocortisone
Antifungals such as ketoconazole or imidazole.One way to treat cradle cap is to warm a small amount of clean, natural oil such as jojoba, almond or olive oil, and massage it into the area affected by cradle cap. After 15 minutes, the flakes can be gently brushed off. The area should then be thoroughly shampooed, with special care taken to ensure that no oil remains on the skin.[2] Flakes can be brushed from the skin by gently using a soft brush or terry cloth towel.Good to know: There is some controversy about the efficacy of olive oil in the treatment of cradle cap. Some studies have shown that olive oil disturbs the natural skin barrier, but others have cast doubt on this.[4]White petroleum jelly can be applied daily and is known to soften scales, which can then be brushed off. Regular washing with baby shampoo is also useful.[3] In some cases, coal tar shampoo may be used, but this can sometimes irritate the skin. The same is true for shampoos devised to control dandruff; as these can sting, they are not very suitable for use on babies.[8]Hydrocortisone, imidazole or ketoconazole are all available as prescription creams or gels for use in the treatment of severe cases of cradle cap. Imidazole or ketoconazole creams are applied several times a week, while hydrocortisone cream is applied daily.[9]",[],[]
Crohn’s Disease,https://ada.com/conditions/crohns-disease/,,"A person who is affected by Crohn’s disease may experience a wide range of symptoms which may also vary in severity.Common symptoms of Crohn’s disease include:[2]Digestive discomfort: This takes the form of abdominal pain and cramping and often occurs one or two hours after eating, but may occur at any time. People with Crohn’s disease often avoid eating or eat less in order to avoid digestive discomfort, which can lead to weight loss. Digestive discomfort is usually at its worst when an individual is experiencing a flare-up of the disease.[3]
Diarrhea: This is one of the main symptoms of Crohn’s disease and happens when the gut cannot absorb all the necessary fluid from food during the digestive process. This often creates a sense of urgency and needing to rush to the toilet.[4]
Fatigue: A high percentage of people with Crohn’s disease are affected by fatigue.[5] This may be caused by lack of sleep, which in people with Crohn’s disease is common due to digestive discomfort, high stress levels, depression and using medication of which insomnia and/or discomfort are side effects.[6]Fatigue may also be caused by malnutrition which is a common consequence of Crohn’s disease, as the inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract can result in a less efficient uptake of the essential compounds derived from food, which the body needs in order to function properly. People with Crohn’s disease are commonly found to be deficient in iron, vitamin B12 and vitamin D.[7] These deficiencies often correlate to a loss in muscle strength.[8]
Blood in one’s stools: Crohn’s disease typically causes bleeding in the lower digestive tract, which manifests as bright red blood in one’s stools. The condition may also cause bleeding in the colon, associated with inflammation, anal fissures and fistulas.[9]
Mucus in one’s stools: A healthy intestine produces a certain amount of mucus in order to protect and lubricate the bowel area. When a person is affected by Crohn’s disease, the production of mucus can increase, resulting in surplus mucus emerging with one’s stools. This usually takes the form of a gel-like material which appears to coat the stool.[10]
Unintentional weight loss: Due to avoiding certain foods or food groups and failing to absorb sufficient energy from one’s food as a result of malabsorption and diarrhea, people with Crohn’s disease frequently experience weight loss.Less common symptoms of Crohn’s disease include:[2]Nausea and vomiting
High temperature and/or being prone to fevers
Swelling and pain in the joints
Mouth ulcers
Skin irritation involving redness, swelling and itching
Uveitis, i.e. red and irritated eyes","Approximately 1.6 million people in the U.S. are affected by either Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, the other prominent form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).[20] The exact reasons why Crohn’s disease develops in people are unknown, but it is believed to be the result of an interaction of possible factors.When it encounters environmental or genetic factors, or a combination of the two, the immune system can be triggered, resulting in the inflammation associated with Crohn’s disease.Foreign substances (antigens) which one encounters, particularly those related to smoking tobacco and to one’s diet, may irritate and cause inflammation in the intestines, resulting in the development of Crohn’s disease. Alternatively, these stimuli may correlate to an autoimmune response, whereby the body’s immune system causes areas of the gastrointestinal system to become inflamed.Risk factorsAnyone can be affected by Crohn’s disease, but it is most likely to manifest in people between the ages of 10 and 40.Factors which increase one’s risk of experiencing Crohn’s disease include:Being of European descent, in particular of Ashkenazi Jewish origin)[21]
Smoking tobacco[22]
Being female[23]
Genetic factors: Having an affected family member is a significant risk factor for developing Crohn’s disease, but the exact inheritance pattern for the condition is unknown.","People often experience the symptoms of Crohn’s disease for many years before being diagnosed with the condition. In order to establish a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease, doctors will consider a person’s medical history and symptoms and will also perform a physical examination. They will often also conduct laboratory studies and further tests in order to establish the nature and severity of the condition.Diagnostic techniques for Crohn’s disease include:[24]A full survey of a person’s medical history, including when their symptoms began, their dietary habits, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), history of smoking and whether they have a family history of Crohn’s disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Doctors will pay particular attention to noting whether they have been affected by appendicitis.
A physical examination which will take into account an individual’s height, weight, sex, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and will include a digital-rectal examination, an examination of the abdomen, as well as a survey of the eyes, joints, heartbeat, lungs, back, pulse, and the skin and muscles, where extraintestinal symptoms of Crohn’s disease may be found.
Laboratory studies will be performed in order to test one’s levels of electrolytes and creatinine, and a full blood count (FBC) test will be carried out to detect infection and anemia. Tests will also be performed to establish one’s levels of nitrogen, bilirubin, transferrin vitamin B12 and folic acid. Doctors will also prescribe tests to determine the individual’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate (the rate at which red blood cells coagulate), liver function tests and a urine strip to test for irregularities in the content of their urine.
Imaging studies such as MRI and CT scans will be used to screen extraintestinal symptoms such as fistulas, abscesses or sclerosing cholangitis (liver disease). People who are suspected of having Crohn’s disease will often undergo an ileocolonoscopy, in which a tube-like device containing a camera is passed through the colon in order to examine the ileum, and/or an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, in which the tube-like device is swallowed in order to examine problems relating to the upper gastrointestinal tract.If it is not possible to scan the terminal ileum using conventional imaging studies, a wireless capsule endoscopy may be prescribed, which involves swallowing a small device containing a camera. This is often used to investigate unexplained bleeding in the gastrointestinal area.[25]
Biopsy samples from at least five segments of the gastrointestinal tract will be taken during the esophagogastroduodenoscopy in order to investigate the extent of the inflammation, and the inflammatory cell infiltrate, lymphocytes and plasma cells.
Stool samples will be taken to test for the presence of the Clostridium difficile bacteria, which causes diarrhea and gastrointestinal conditions.
Microbial studies via stool samples will be performed to identify the microorganisms, including pathogens and members of the indigenous microbiota, which may be present in an individual’s gastrointestinal system and which may initiate or propagate the inflammatory process characteristic of Crohn’s disease.[26]The testing process to determine a definitive diagnosis of Crohn’s disease is thorough. This is due to the fact that the condition is one of many, which are associated with pain and cramping in the abdomen.Conditions which are often confused with Crohn’s disease, and which will be ruled out during the course of the diagnostic process include:Stomach ulcers
Gastritis (stomach irritation)
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which has similar symptoms to Crohn’s disease, but is a much less serious condition, which does not result in damage to the intestine
Gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD)
Appendicitis
Ulcerative colitis, the other main form of inflammatory bowel diseaseThe final step in the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease involves collecting information to devise a treatment plan for the affected individual. This assessment will be performed by a doctor specialising in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, called a gastroenterologist.This initial assessment will establish:[27]The extent of the disease
Complications such as fistulae and stricturing
Nutritional status and deficiencies
Bone density and the corresponding risk of conditions such as osteoporosis","There is currently no cure for Crohn’s disease, but there are many treatment options available to alleviate the symptoms. Treatment for Crohn’s disease focuses on:Treating the symptoms
Minimising flare ups
Maintaining periods of remissionWith effective treatment, many people with Crohn’s disease will experience significant periods, possibly several years, without symptoms. For people with more severe forms of the condition, and for whom medications do not provide significant relief from the symptoms, surgery may be required.Steroid medicationInitial treatment of Crohn’s disease will usually involve the prescription of steroid medications (corticosteroids), which are used to reduce inflammation. These may take the form of tablets or injections, depending on what is determined to be suitable for the affected individual.[28]However, long-term usage of corticosteroids is associated with problematic side effects, which may include:Swelling of the face
Unwanted weight gain
Increased susceptibility to infections
Bone density loss and resultant osteoporosisWhen a person embarks on a course of corticosteroid medication, an aim of this treatment will usually be to reduce the dose over time, so as to minimise one’s exposure to harmful side effects.Good to know: As an alternative to corticosteroids, some people may be prescribed a milder steroid or a type of medication called a 5-aminosalicylate. However, these tend to be less effective at alleviating gastrointestinal inflammation.Polymeric dietFor individuals, whose growth and development may have been affected by Crohn’s disease, a polymeric (liquid) diet administered through a nasogastric tube may be recommended as an initial treatment. Many studies have been undertaken, comparing the polymeric diet to steroid medication, and it is considered an equally effective first-line treatment for Crohn’s disease.[29]A polymeric diet will be prescribed in order to allow the digestive system to recover from being inflamed and to support the uptake of nutrients, a process which is often compromised by the inflammation that is characteristic of Crohn's disease.[29]A person who has been prescribed a polymeric diet will progress to slowly reintroducing solid foods into their diet in a controlled setting, in order to safeguard the period of remission facilitated by undertaking the liquid diet.[30]ImmunosuppressantsIf a person, who is being treated with corticosteroids or the polymeric diet, experiences a flare up of their symptoms twice or more during one year, or finds that they return when their steroid dose is reduced, medicines which suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants) may be prescribed in combination with the initial course of treatment.The immunosuppressant medications which are most commonly prescribed for the treatment of Crohn’s disease are azathioprine and mercaptopurine. They work by damping down the over-activity of the cells within the immune system.[31] An alternative medication is methotrexate, a form of immunosuppressant which is not recommended for use during pregnancy.It is vital that a blood test is performed before immunosuppressant medication is prescribed. A high score on this test relating to factors such as an elevated white blood cell count and increased lymph production, may indicate immunosuppressant toxicity, which means that these medications are not suitable for the affected individual.[32]People who are using immunosuppressant medication in the treatment of Crohn’s disease will undergo regular blood tests in order to ensure that the medication continues to agree with them, so that their use can be discontinued if needed, averting the presence of unwanted side effects.Possible side effects of immunosuppressant medication include:Nausea and vomiting
Susceptibility to infection
Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)
Liver problems
Anemia, characterised by feeling tired, breathless and weakBiologic therapiesBiologic therapies are a type of immunosuppressant medications which use substances, such as antibodies and enzymes, to inhibit the effects of Crohn’s disease.The development of biologic therapies therefore presents a breakthrough alternative treatment option for those who are unwilling or unable to use steroid medication. Historically, people with Crohn’s disease and other types of IBD faced a lack of effective treatment options. Corticosteroid therapy does not alleviate the symptoms of Crohn’s disease in all cases and for those whose symptoms do not respond to it, prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy and surgery were previously the only options.[33]If a person responds well to biologic therapy, its benefits may include:Removal of the need to use steroid medication, thereby avoiding its side effects
Prolonged periods in which the disease is in remission
Potential delay or negation of the need for surgery to redress intestinal damage caused by Crohn’s diseaseWhy is biologic therapy not always offered as a first-line treatment?Medical opinion is divided as to whether biologic therapies should be a first-line treatment option, and many doctors prefer to investigate whether a case of Crohn’s disease can be treated with corticosteroids, a liquid diet or traditional immunosuppressants initially, before considering biologic therapy.The principal reason that some doctors prefer to prescribe traditional treatment methods first is that less is understood about the mechanism of action of biologic medications, and how different people will respond to them. Allergic reactions to the medications used in biologic therapies may occur –immediately or months after stopping treatment – and these can be life-threatening.Methods of administrationThe two medications used in biologic therapy for Crohn’s disease are Infliximab and Adalimumab.These medications are considered to be broadly comparable in terms of their effectiveness in bringing about prolonged periods of remission and preventing the development of complications, such as intestinal obstructions, which require surgery.[34] Both children and adults can be prescribed Infliximab but Adalimumab is only suitable for adults.Both medications are usually prescribed on a twelve month course, after which the need to continue will be reviewed, based on the individual’s response and the stability of the periods of remission following dosing.Infliximab is administered as an infusion via a drip into a vein and requires one to visit a hospital to receive the medication as an outpatient procedure.Adalimumab can be administered as an injection, and one can learn to do this independently or with the help of another person, meaning that hospital visits are not necessary in order to redose. Doctors will advise on the type of medication that is appropriate in each individual case of Crohn’s disease.SurgeryThe type of surgical procedure which will be prescribed in this case is called a resection. Doctors will consider performing a resection to remove the inflamed sections of the intestinal tract in cases where the symptoms of Crohn’s disease have not been alleviated by other treatments.A resection is a major procedure and usually performed under general anaesthetic. When the inflamed sections of the intestine have been removed, the healthy sections will be stitched together.Ileostomy (temporary or permanent)An ileostomy is a procedure which involves diverting one’s digestive waste away from the colon in order to give the area, which has undergone a resection, a chance to heal.[35] This can be temporary or permanent.The type of ileostomy prescribed as an adjunct to a resection is usually a loop ileostomy, a temporary version of ileostomy, performed under general anaesthetic, which will be reversed after the body has had a chance to recover from undergoing resection surgery.[36]In a loop ileostomy, an opening in the lower abdominal area, called a stoma, is surgically created. An ileostomy bag, also called a colostomy bag or pouch, is then attached to the small intestine through the stoma. The bag hangs outside the body and collects the waste products that would otherwise have passed into one’s large intestine and out of one’s rectum.[36] Normal function of the digestive system will be restored when the ileostomy is reversed.A loop ileostomy is not always necessary as an accompaniment to a resection. One’s physician will advise on whether the procedure is needed.",[],"Q: Does Crohn’s disease reduce one’s life expectancy?
A: In many cases, people with Crohn’s disease are able to live a normal lifespan, due to the extent to which treatments are now successfully able to mitigate the symptoms of Crohn’s disease.[38]Q: How is Crohn’s disease different from ulcerative colitis?
A: Ulcerative colitis is the other main form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and shares several important characteristics with Crohn’s disease. They are both chronic (long-term) conditions which involve inflammation of the gut and fatigue. However, ulcerative colitis only affects the large intestine, whereas Crohn’s disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal system.[39]The two conditions differ in their symptoms. People with Crohn’s disease may produce stools containing mucus, blood and/or undigested fats, whereas stool samples from people with ulcerative colitis are more likely to contain only mucus and/or blood. Tenesmus (rectal pain) is more characteristic of ulcerative colitis than Crohn’s disease, whereas fistulae and weight loss are more likely to occur in cases of Crohn’s disease. It is common for someone with Crohn’s disease to experience regular fevers, whereas this would be symptomatic of a severe flare-up in someone with ulcerative colitis.[40]Q: Is there a cure for Crohn’s disease?
A: There is not currently a cure for Crohn’s disease. However, many people with the condition are able to achieve periods of remission, which last years or even decades due to accessing effective treatment options. With regard to developing a cure, a recent study has built on existing research into available treatments for Crohn’s disease. The findings suggest that alternative mechanisms, which can permanently intercept the workings of the disease, may be developed by 2030.[41]"
Cryptorchidism,https://ada.com/conditions/cryptorchidism/,,[],"Most cases of cryptorchidism have no obvious cause.Risk factors for cryptorchidismRisk factors for having a male infant with undescended testicles include:[2][6][11][^AB]Premature birth
Low birth weight
A family history of undescended testicles, particularly in a father or brother
Maternal exposure to chemicals, such as diethystilbestrol, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, phthalates, and dioxins, polyvinyl chloride, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or bisphenol A (BPA)
Existing congenital malformations of the urinary system or abdominal wall, such as bladder exstrophy[12], prune-belly syndrome,[13] gastroschisis,[14] or hypospadias
Hereditary syndromes affecting the hypothalamus, connective tissues or nervous system
Consanguinity of parents","As cryptorchidism is largely asymptomatic, most cases are discovered by caregivers or physicians doing routine physical examinations. If the infant is warm and relaxed, but the testes are not present in the scrotum, they may have undescended testicles.[11] In some cases, especially if the infant is cold, surprised or upset, the cremasteric reflex[15] may cause the testicles to retract out of the scrotum into the body. If this happens, the examination will have to be repeated when the infant is warm and calm.The majority, around 80 percent, of undescended testicles are palpable (can be felt) during physical examination, due to their location in the neck of the scrotum. If they are in the abdomen or inguinal canal, they may be non-palpable. In such cases, a laparoscopic examination may be necessary to locate them. A laparoscopic exam involves inserting a laparoscope, a thin and flexible device with a camera, into the inguinal canal or abdomen.In some cases, if the cryptorchidism affects both testicles (bilateral) and the testes are non-palpable, the infant may need to be assessed for a possible disorder or sexual differentiation. In such rare cases, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to locate the undescended testicles, especially if they are in the abdomen.[4] In rare cases, only one testicle may be present. This is known as monorchidism. Complete absence of testicles, known as anorchia, is extremely uncommon.[1]Ideally, undescended testes should be located and treatment begun before the infant reaches one year of age.[1] Early treatment gives the testicle the best chance of developing normally, maintaining fertility and minimizing the risk of testicular cancer.[4]","Undescended testicles must be treated if they have not descended spontaneously by the time the child is six months of age. After that age, they are unlikely to descend on their own. The goal of treatment for undescended testicles is to move viable undescended testes to the correct position in the scrotum and to remove nonviable testicular tissue if it is present.The usual course of treatment is almost always surgery, known as orchidopexy, although in some cases, hormonal treatment may be possible.OrchidopexyIn cases where the testicle is palpable, the testis can be repositioned using a procedure known as an orchidopexy. The testicle needs to be palpable for this surgery to be an option.In an orchidopexy, which is usually performed between the ages of six months and 11 years of age, the undescended testicle is brought into the scrotum, along with the vas deferens,[16] testicular blood vessels and spermatic cord. It is then fixed in the scrotum with sutures.[4] This procedure can be done laparoscopically or by open surgery. It is usually done through an incision in the inguinal area,the groin.[1]If the undescended testis is not palpable, exploratory surgery is performed to determine whether the testis is present at all and then, if it is, whether it is viable. This exploratory surgery can be open surgery or laparoscopic surgery.[^AA]If the testis is present and viable, a laparoscopic orchidopexy can be performed. In this case, a laparoscope — a small, slender instrument equipped with a light and a camera — will be used to locate the testis and then guide the procedure to bring it into position. Open surgery is not usually performed in cases where the exact location of the testis is unknown.[1]If the testicle is high in the abdomen, complications may occur because the blood vessels and spermatic cord may not be long enough to allow movement into the scrotum.[17] If it is discovered that no testes are present, or that only one is present, any atrophied testicular tissue that is found will be removed.Orchidopexies should be performed as early as possible to maximize fertility potential in later life and keep the risk of testicular cancer to a minimum. Also, they are easier to do if the child is still physically small, as the distances that the vessels and organs need to be moved are shorter.[4]Surgery in the form of orchidopexy is considered the best and most effective treatment for undescended testicles. There is usually no likelihood of long-term problems following such a procedure.[11]Hormonal treatmentHormonal therapy for undescended testicles is controversial and not widely recommended. It is not generally believed to be very effective, only working in about a fifth of cases.[2]",[],"Q: Will I be able to have children if I have a corrected undescended testicle?
A: Yes. If you received treatment early in life, you will have a similar paternity rate as men who had normally-descended testicles.Q: Does having an undescended testicle affect my testosterone levels?** 
A: Yes. It may lead to your testosterone levels being lower than the norm. When this is caused by undescended testicles, it is known as primary hypogonadism. However, if your undescended testis was corrected early in life, your testosterone levels may be normal.[23]Low testosterone can also be caused by injury to the testicle, diabetes, medication, aging or even pituitary tumors.Q: How do I check for testicular cancer?** 
A: The most common first symptom of testicular cancer is a painless lump on or inside a testicle. Men should routinely check their testicles for lumps, which can be done by rolling their testicles gently between their fingers and noting any changes. If a lump is found, or there is pain that is not the result of applying too much pressure, men should seek medical help."
Cushing’s Syndrome,https://ada.com/conditions/cushings-syndrome/,,"The typical symptoms include a red, full face (moon face), weight gain around the belly, a hump between the shoulders, skin changes (thinning, stretch marks, easy bruising, increased hair growth) and muscle weakness. Women may become hairier than they previously were. Children may not grow as fast as their peers. Cortisol may affect sexual function and some men may experience erection problems and decreased sexual desire.",[],"Diagnosis is made by evaluating a person's medical history, with special attention to medications, and physical examination where the doctor checks for the typical signs of Cushing’s syndrome. If a medication isn't the cause of the symptoms, saliva, urine and blood tests are done to test cortisol hormone levels, and imaging tests (ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) may be done to look for a cause for the excess cortisol.","The treatment depends on the cause of the high cortisol level. If it is caused by a high intake of cortisol, the dosage of the medication should be reduced slowly. People taking steroid medications should never stop these medications suddenly. If a growth is the underlying reason, then it may have to be removed by surgery. If it is not safe to remove the cause of the high cortisol levels, cortisol can be blocked by other medications.",Taking care to avoid long term use of cortisol-containing medications may help to prevent some cases of Cushing’s syndrome.,[]
Cutaneous Burns,https://ada.com/conditions/cutaneous-burns/,,"The symptoms and the appearance of a burn both depend on the degree of the burn, which is determined by the depth of the skin affected by the burn. There are three different degrees. First degree, or superficial, burns cause red, swollen and painful skin, which doesn't blister. Second degree burns cause blistering skin and the skin under the blister may be slightly numb. Third degree burns cause the skin to turn black or white, and are usually painless due to nerve damage.",[],The diagnosis is made based on the symptoms and by examining the burned skin.,"Treatment depends on the degree and the extent of the injuries. First of all, the person should be removed from the source of the heat. Small first or second degree burns may be cooled under running water for a few minutes. People who suffer larger, more serious burns should be treated by emergency services and specialist burn units. Emergency treatment involves giving fluids, keeping the person warm and preventing infections. Once the immediate danger has passed, the affected person may receive skin grafts to help the skin grow back and reduce scarring. Complications, such as infections in wounds, are treated with antibiotics if they occur.","The best prevention for burns is to follow safety precautions when handling fire, hot liquids or chemicals. This includes supervising children while cooking, while bathing and at times where they could come into contact with an open flame.",[]
Cyclothymic Disorder,https://ada.com/conditions/cyclothymic-disorder/,,"People with cyclothymic disorders experience frequent swings between high and low mood. These swings are extreme enough to be classified as hypomania and depression, though not as extreme as those found in bipolar disorder.The frequency of mood swings in cyclothymic disorder is higher than in bipolar disorder. There may be no periods of stable mood between episodes, and periods of stable mood will last for less than two months. Depressive symptoms will have lasted for at least two years or one year for children and teenagers. High and low moods will be experienced for at least half the time.[6][7]People with cyclothymic disorder tend to have extreme reactions to external events or stimuli. They can be overly happy and enthusiastic in response to a positive event, such as:[8]Success at work
A period of good weather
Feelings created by substances, like drugs and alcoholThey can also be overly pessimistic and depressed by negative events, such as:A relationship setback
Onset of winter
Stressful situations, such as moving housePeople experiencing symptoms of cyclothymic disorder should seek professional medical help. In addition, they can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.HypomaniaPeople with cyclothymic disorder can experience hypomania, which is a feeling of exaggerated happiness or wellbeing (euphoria). It is not as extreme as mania. Someone experiencing hypomania may appear to be managing day-to-day activities well, though it can still be disruptive.[8][9][10]Symptoms and signs of hypomania in cyclothymic disorder can also include:Being irritable and agitated
Impulsive and risky behaviour
Extreme optimism
Lack of inhibitions and poor judgement
Racing thoughts and talking more than usual
Increased sexual drive
Easily distracted
Overly confident and inflated sense of self-esteem
Not sleeping much
Excessive physical activity or fidgetingUnlike bipolar disorder, hypomania in cyclothymic disorder will not develop into mania.[3]DepressionSomeone with cyclothymic disorder will experience depression, which is characterized by low mood. These feelings are more intense and longer-lasting than the feelings of sadness that everyone experiences from time to time.Symptoms and signs of depression in cyclothymic disorder can include:[8][11][12]Low mood for most of the time
Feeling hungrier than usual
Weight changes
Feeling very fatigued and sluggish
Sleeping more or less than usual
Not enjoying life and activities, even ones normally found pleasurable
Feeling upset or tearful
Lack of concentration or motivation
Feeling guilty or worthless
Loss of interest in sexual activity and intimacy
Loss of interest in activities and hobbies
Being irritable, agitated or tense
Being restless
Suicidal thoughts and feelingsMixed episodesPeople with cyclothymic disorder have a high tendency towards experiencing depression combined with the high energy of hypomania. This is known as a mixed state or mixed episode.[8][11]Mixed episodes can be difficult to cope with, because the emotional experience is confusing. Someone in a mixed state also poses a greater risk of attempted suicide, as the person may feel the sadness and hopelessness of depression while in an energized state.[6]","It is not known what causes cyclothymic disorder. However, people with the condition often have relatives with bipolar disorder, and there is thought to be a hereditary link.[5][13]","Cyclothymic disorder shares some characteristics with bipolar disorder, but is less intense. This can feel as though the condition is being classified as not serious, when in fact it can have a significant impact on a person’s life.[2]The ICD-10[17] defines cyclothymic disorder as having numerous periods of depression and mild elation, or hypomania, none of which are severe, or extended enough, to be classified as bipolar disorder.[13]DSM-5 criteria[18] defines cyclothymic disorder as having the same mood swings as the ICD-10, but notes that:[8][7]A person should have had many periods of hypomania, and periods of depression for at least two years, or one year in children and teenagers
Stable moods should last for less than two months at a time
Symptoms do not meet the criteria for bipolar disorder or another mental health condition
Symptoms are not caused by another medical condition or by substance misuse
Symptoms significantly affect day-to-day lifeDiagnosis will be made by taking a medical history, possibly in discussion with a psychiatrist. Blood and urine tests may be carried out to eliminate physical causes for the mood swings. For example, hyperthyroidism may also cause mood swings.[5][19]","A person with cyclothymic disorder can require treatment even during periods of stable mood. Treatment should be guided by a mental health provider with experience in treating the condition.If necessary, cyclothymic disorder should be treated with psychotherapy combined with appropriate medication.PsychotherapyPsychoeducation is a talking treatment that helps one gain insight into a condition and its effects.[20] Cyclothymic disorder may be a pleasurable experience for some people, and psychoeducation can help bring about acceptance that the condition needs to be treated.[8]Other talking therapies, such as support groups or cognitive behavior therapy (CBT),[21] can help someone with cyclothymic disorder manage the condition and prevent it affecting day-to-day life. The duration of psychotherapy sessions will depend on clinical need.[5][22]Long-term psychotherapy can help by:[6]Instigating healthy daily routines
Developing strategies to cope with extreme emotional responses
Rebuilding self esteemMedicationWhether to treat cyclothymic disorder with medication, and what kind of medication to use, depends on how difficult the person with the condition finds day-to-day life.Mood stabilizers can work by evening out the high and low mood swings. Commonly prescribed mood stabilizers include valproic acid, lamotrigine and lithium. However, people with cyclothymic disorder may not respond as well to medication as people with bipolar disorder.[3]When prescribed on their own for people with cyclothymic disorder, antidepressants can potentially trigger manic episodes or increase the frequency of episodes. If antidepressants are used as a treatment they should be used in conjunction with a mood stabilizer.[8][22]For more information about these medications, see the resource on bipolar disorder.Life-long medication may not be necessary. The goal is to achieve a significant period of stable mood, such as six months to one year. If stability can be maintained through psychotherapy, the person under treatment may be able to stop taking medication. However, this decision should be made in conjunction with a medical professional.[8][22]",[],"Q: Is there a test for cyclothymic disorder?
A: There is no test to see if you have cyclothymic disorder. If you think you might have the condition, your doctor will talk to you about your mood history and make an assessment. You may be referred to a psychiatrist if necessary.Q: Can cyclothymic disorder turn into bipolar disorder?
A: Some people with cyclothymic disorder will develop bipolar disorder. It’s unclear exactly what determines who will develop bipolar disorder and who will not, but it’s thought that between 15 percent and 50 percent of people with cyclothymic disorder will go on to develop bipolar disorder.Q: Can cyclothymic disorder be cured?
A: Some people with cyclothymic disorder will find that symptoms go away with time and treatment. It isn’t clear whose symptoms will disappear and whose will not.Q: Is cyclothymic disorder a personality disorder?
A: Cyclothymic disorder is considered a subset of bipolar disorder. People with cyclothymic disorder are often thought of as having a particular type of personality, in that they switch rapidly between highs and lows and have extreme responses to positive and negative events. Someone with cyclothymic disorder may also have a personality disorder, such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).[6]"
Cystic Fibrosis,https://ada.com/conditions/cystic-fibrosis/,,"Although it is a genetic condition, the symptoms of cystic fibrosis usually begin around 6 or 8 months after birth. Newborns with cystic fibrosis may not pass meconium (the first bowel movement) and/or may have long-lasting jaundice. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, coughing and coughing up thick, sticky mucus. People with cystic fibrosis tend to have sweat that is unusually rich in salt, which may be tasted when kissing the child. As children grow older, they develop club-like fingers and toes, and tend to be small for their age. They may also have recurrent chest or sinus infections. Children with cystic fibrosis may suffer from repeated constipation, indigestion or bloating, and produce white, greasy stools.",[],"In countries where cystic fibrosis is common, newborns are screened (tested regardless of the manifestation of symptoms) for the genetic mutations of cystic fibrosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by testing sweat and by fully investigating the genes for the cystic fibrosis mutation.","There is no cure for cystic fibrosis. Treatment aims to manage the symptoms and complications of cystic fibrosis. This involves daily exercises and treatments to remove extra mucus from the lungs, replacing digestive enzymes that are usually released by the pancreas, and supplementing the diet with calories and nutrients, among other measures.

Dengue Fever,https://ada.com/conditions/dengue-fever/,,"The symptoms of dengue fever usually begin to develop in between four and ten days after
infection with the virus. They include:Fever (above 38 C or 100.4 F)
Severe headaches
Body aches (including muscle and joint pain)
Pain behind the eyes
Nausea and vomiting
Weakness
A widespread red body rash
A loss of appetitePeople with these symptoms, especially those currently in or recently returned from an area
with a known danger of dengue infection, should see a medical professional as soon as possible.
The symptoms of dengue fever can often be confused with flu or another virus, especially in
young adults, who tend to experience a milder form of the virus. As well as seeing a doctor, the free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment.In some cases, the virus can cause severe symptoms (also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever). Dengue hemorrhagic fever is most common in young children and people who have had the infection previously.Symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever include:Severe abdominal (belly) pain
Bleeding from any part of the body (most commonly the gums)
A very high fever
Persistent vomiting or vomiting blood
Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing
Skin rash
ListlessnessIf the symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever are not well managed, they may develop into dengue shock syndrome. This condition may lead to severe bleeding, insufficient blood flow (shock) and even death.","Dengue fever is spread by mosquitoes, not from person to person. These mosquitoes are most
commonly found in tropical and warm areas, and become most active at night or in the early
morning.Today, dengue fever is common in many tropical areas of the world. While everyone is at equal
risk of being bitten by mosquitoes and contracting the virus, those with weakened immune
systems or those who have previously been infected with the virus are most at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever.[2]Aedes aegyptiThe female Aedes aegypti mosquito is the main carrier of the viruses that cause dengue fever. The virus is passed on via a bite from one of these mosquitos, which generally acquire the virus from the blood of an infected individual.[3]Aedes aegypti typically breed indoors in artificial water containers and spend the majority of their lifespan in or around the location where they emerge. However, Aedes aegypti are capable of biting and spreading the virus in any location (indoor and outdoor) at any time of the day.Aedes aegypti are the mosquito variety most closely associated with dengue fever, however, other mosquito types have also had dengue fever outbreaks attributed to them. These mosquito types include Aedes albopictus, Aedes polynesiensis and several species of the Aedes scutellaris complex.","People with the symptoms of dengue fever should seek a medical opinion as quickly as possible.
Dengue fever is diagnosed with a series of blood tests used to identify the virus itself,
the immune reaction to the infection and other effects the infection may have on the body
(such as reduced blood clotting).","If dengue fever is suspected, medical attention should be sought immediately. Doctors will
generally prescribe rest and plenty of fluids to help support the body in combating the
infection. If symptoms of dengue fever persist or if a person is unwell for longer than
three days, urgent medical attention should be sought to avoid the risk of complications.There is currently no effective vaccine or specific medication to treat dengue fever. Pain
relievers containing acetaminophen (paracetamol) can be used to manage some of the symptoms
(mainly body pain and headache), but aspirin, ibuprofen and any other anti-inflammatory
medication – which can worsen bleeding – should be avoided.","As there is no specific treatment, prevention is key to combating dengue fever. If living
or travelling in tropical areas, taking steps to avoid the reproduction of mosquitoes and
avoid being bitten by mosquitoes is the most effective method of doing this.Reducing the mosquito population by identifying and removing locations where they can breed
should be the first step in dengue fever prevention. These locations include birdbaths,
buckets, old tires and flower pots, or anywhere where standing water can collect.Other effective ways to protect yourself against mosquitoes include:Insect repellents: To be used even when indoors and applied directly to the skin as
well as to clothing. Parents should be aware that children may need repellent that has
been specially approved for use on children.
Loose and protective clothing: Mosquitos are able to bite through tight clothing, so
garments should be loose and cover as much as the body as possible. Light colours are also
preferable to dark.
Mosquito net: When sleeping, a mosquito net is vital for everyone, especially children.
If possible, the net should be treated with insecticide.","Q: Is dengue fever contagious?
A: No. Dengue fever is not spread from person to person but via infected mosquitoes.[5]Q: What does the dengue fever rash look like?
A: A rash is one of the symptoms of dengue fever. Typically, it begins as a mild rash,
giving the infected person a flushed appearance. As the virus develops, the rash can
become more severe, turning bright red and developing lesions.[6]Q: When should I visit the doctor?
A: If there is any suspicion of dengue fever, you should visit a doctor immediately.
A doctor will be able to evaluate your symptoms and make a proper diagnosis.[7] If you have
been diagnosed with dengue fever and the symptoms don’t go away or worsen in three days, a
doctor should be seen once again to reduce the risk of complications.Q: Which liquids should I drink?
A: People with dengue fever are encouraged to drink plenty or water, fruit juice or oral
rehydration solutions. Adults should aim to drink at least three litres of water per day in
order to stay hydrated.[8]**Q: Which liquids should infants drink? **
A: Babies under six months old should drink only breast milk or formula to avoid dehydration.
Babies over six months should also be able to drink water. Doctors may recommend rehydration
solutions for older children.[9]Q: What medicine can I take during dengue fever?
A: Acetaminophen (paracetamol) can be used to manage the body pain and headaches that
typically come with dengue fever. Anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen and aspirin
should be avoided as they may cause complications.[10]Q: What virus causes dengue fever?
A: Dengue fever is caused by four closely related viruses (serotypes): DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4. Although each of these serotypes interacts with the body in a different way, each virus causes the same symptoms to manifest.[11]Q: Is there a vaccine for dengue fever?
A: Twenty countries globally have licensed a dengue fever vaccine named CYD-TDV. The World Health Organization recommends its use on individuals of nine years of age or above living or travelling in countries with a seroprevalence (the extent to which the virus is present in a population, as measured in blood serum) of 70 percent or above. The vaccine does not offer total protection against dengue fever and its efficacy may differ according to age and previous exposure to the viruses that cause dengue fever.[12] It is recommended that a doctor be consulted regarding the availability of the vaccine before travelling to an area with a confirmed dengue fever presence."

Redness of the skin over the affected part of the gum
Bleeding in the gums
Swollen lymph glands in the neck
Generally feeling unwell (malaise)
Loss of appetite or inability to eat
FeverDental examination may also reveal swelling and redness around the tooth in the mouth and a fluctuant (movable/shiftable) mass[9] in the area. Periodontal abscesses may also present with a gum boil. A gum boil, also known as a parulis, is a soft red papule that appears where a sinus or channel from an abscess reaches the outside of the gum, between the gum and the inside of the cheek. It is the result of an abscess, so it is a definite sign that an abscess is present, but it is not itself an abscess.In severe, rare cases of dental abscess, the affected person may also experience:[5]Cellulitis, a bacterial infection of skin and subcutaneous tissues
Lockjaw (trismus)
Difficulty swallowing
Difficulty breathing
Difficulty speaking
DehydrationGenerally, a spreading dental infection as a result of an abscess may cause the affected person to feel very unwell. They may have a fever (a body temperature of 100.4 F or higher), swelling in the floor of the mouth, the face or the jaw and severe pain that does not respond to maximum doses of over-the-counter painkillers.If any of these symptoms occur, the affected person should seek emergency dental care or, if no dental care is available, visit a hospital emergency department. While doctors are not trained to handle dental procedures, they will be able to assist with antibiotics and painkillers to control the infection and pain until dental care is accessed.",[],"If a dental abscess is suspected, the affected person should visit the dentist as soon as possible. The dentist will perform an examination of the affected area. They may test the affected tooth by pressing on it or tapping it with an instrument.[6] If the tooth is infected, it will be very sensitive to pressure or tapping (percussion). Further, if the abscess is periapical, the swelling at the root will push the tooth upwards in its socket, and it will feel higher than the surrounding teeth.While laboratory testing is not usually needed to establish whether or not an abscess is present, dentists will usually do an X-ray of the affected tooth and the mouth as a whole to establish the exact location and the size of the abscess.[5]The abscess may be aspirated[10] and the pus cultured to determine which strains of bacteria are involved. This helps to guide antibiotic therapy if it is needed.[5]","The usual treatment for a dental abscess is to drain pus as soon as it is possible to do so. This will be done surgically, either by a dentist or a maxillofacial surgeon, a surgeon that has trained as a dentist as well as a doctor and handles complex jaw, tooth and mouth conditions.[5] They may make an incision in the gum or drill a hole in the tooth to allow the pus to drain.[1]Once the pus has drained away, the area will be cleaned. In periapical abscesses, all dead pulpal tissue will be removed  to prevent infection recurring.[1] In periodontal abscesses, a very deep cleaning of the teeth and specifically the gum and roots will be done. A root canal may also be necessary if the whole tooth is compromised. If the decay is severe, the tooth may be removed.Root canal treatment is the standard treatment for the removal of pulpal tissue in cases where the tooth will be retained and not extracted, and it may also be an option in cases where pain is ongoing even after the abscess is resolved.[11]  The person undergoing a root canal will be given a local anesthetic injection to numb the parts of the jaw and mouth affected by the abscess. During the procedure, the dead or infected pulp is removed, the inside of the pulp canals are smoothed, and the pulp is replaced with a filling, often gutta percha.[12] In a few months time, an X-ray and dental checkup will be done to check that the site is healing properly.As abscesses are painful, affected people may need acetaminophen or ibuprofen to control the pain. Essential oil of cloves has topical anesthetic properties and can be applied to the painful area, although it is very important to maintain strict hygiene while doing this. Home remedies like the above mentioned oil may provide some pain relief, but will not cure an abscess or prevent further infection.In uncomplicated abscesses, antibiotics will not be necessary.If the infection is severe or has spread or if the abscess cannot be drained, antibiotics will be prescribed to help bring the infection under control. Antibiotics commonly prescribed for dental abscesses include:[5]Penicillin
Amoxicillin, alone or in combination with clavulanate
Azithromycin
Metronidazole
CefoxitinIf the patient is allergic to amoxicillin and/or penicillin, clindamycin may be prescribed. Penicillin is the usual antibiotic used to treat mild or moderate infections. Because antibiotics alone don’t always penetrate the abscess very well, the abscess may also be surgically drained.[5]Most dental abscesses are straightforward to treat and resolve completely after they are drained.Complications of dental abscessIn some rare cases, complications do arise. These can include:[1][5][13][14]Cellulitis, an infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues.
Ludwig angina, which occurs when cellulitis spreads into the tissues under the tongue, in the lower jaw and under the chin. It is also known as submandibular cellulitis/submandibular space infection.
Osteomyelitis, an infection of underlying bone.
Parapharyngeal abscess, an abscess at the back of the mouth, near the throat. It is caused by staphylococcal and/or streptococcal bacteria. It is most common in children aged five years or younger.
Cavernous sinus thrombosis, which can occur when the infection spreads into the blood vessels in the sinuses of the head.These conditions require very urgent medical attention.Parapharyngeal abscesses and Ludwig angina can both cause swelling severe enough to obstruct the airways and cause difficulty breathing. Parapharyngeal abscesses require a CT scan and needle aspiration to diagnose. Ludwig angina is diagnosed by CT scan, needle aspiration and X-rays. Treatment for Ludwig angina, parapharyngeal abscess, osteomyelitis, cellulitis and cavernous sinus thrombosis involves drainage of any pus that is present, possibly via surgery and antibiotics and possibly intravenous antibiotics.",[],[]
Depression in Childhood or Adolescence,https://ada.com/conditions/depression-in-childhood-or-adolescence/,,"Symptoms of depression vary with age. Small children may express depression by uncontrollable crying or reluctance to eat or play. They may develop slower than other children and seem less interactive than other children. School-aged children appear impulsive, easily frustrated and sometimes have social and learning difficulties. They may develop self-harming behavior. Symptoms in teenagers can sometimes be difficult to recognize, but include a persistently low mood, and a lack of energy and motivation. They may experience or describe feelings of inner emptiness, insecurity, and trouble concentrating. Teenagers also experience physical symptoms, such as difficulty sleeping, stomach pain, a loss of appetite, weight loss or gain and headaches. Their school performance may gradually get worse. Less commonly, some teenagers may develop thoughts of death or suicide.",[],"The diagnosis is usually made by an experienced child psychologist or psychiatrist based on the symptoms described by the young person. The doctor should rule out other possible causes for the symptoms. Some blood tests can be helpful to rule out these other causes. Keeping a diary which documents the patient’s mood, sleep, energy and thoughts might be helpful in making the diagnosis.","The treatment of depression in children and teenagers is guided by the severity of the symptoms and the circumstances of the child and their family. Treatment commonly involves psychotherapy (counseling) and sometimes medication. Counseling often involves the family, and is typically focussed on helping a young person learn to recognize and control their thoughts and feelings, and on teaching them healthy coping skills. Treatment is slow and steady, and it may take weeks to months until improvement is seen.","A reliable source of emotional support may help to prevent young people developing depression. Exercise, enough sleep and a healthy diet are also very important. Early recognition, diagnosis and treatment are all factors which can reduce the chance of depression in chilhood becoming a lifelong condition.",[]
Depressive Episode,https://ada.com/conditions/depressive-episode/,,"The symptoms of a depressive episode typically include a depressed mood, i.e. feeling sad, empty or hopeless, and/or loss of interest or enjoyment in most activities, together with any number of the following:[1][9]Feeling worthless or excessively guilty
Fatigue or lethargy
Difficulty with concentration, memory and decision-making
Insomnia, not being able to sleep through the night, waking up early or sleeping too much
Appetite changes
Unexplained weight loss or gain
Unexplained physical ailments that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive problems or pain
Sluggishness, restlessness, agitation or irritability
Thoughts of death or suicide, sometimes with suicide plans or suicide attemptsThese symptoms are usually present every day or almost every day, for at least two weeks.[1]Signs of depression may differ according to sex and age. There are various types of depression and depressive disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder (previously known as manic depression), postpartum depression and dysthymia, among others.[10]If you think that you might be experiencing depression, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.If a person seems to be in imminent danger of harming themselves, an emergency support provider should be contacted immediately.","The causes of depressive episodes are complex and varied, involving social, psychological and biological factors. Depression may occur as an isolated episode or as part of a chronic depressive condition.[4] While the exact causes are not yet fully understood, the following may increase a person’s likelihood of experiencing a depressive episode:[2][3][4][11][12]History of depressive episodes
Bipolar disorder
Anxiety
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
Other mental health conditions
Family history of depression
Changes in the functioning of the brain
History of sleep problems
Chronic pain
Heart disease, cancer and other chronic health conditions
Stressful life events such as losing one’s job, losing a loved one (bereavement) or psychological trauma
Lack of personal support structures
Drug and alcohol abuse
Childhood traumaPeople who have recently had a baby may experience postpartum depression.[13]Sometimes, there is no obvious cause for the occurence of a depressive episode.[12]Some health conditions, such as hypothyroidism, can cause symptoms of depression.[3] While uncommon, adverse reactions to certain medications can also cause depressed mood.[2] However, treating these underlying causes and disorders should alleviate the symptoms.","After taking the affected person’s medical history and performing a physical examination, a doctor or the mental health specialist to which the person is referred to, can diagnose a depressive episode based on the criteria set out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).A major depressive episode (MDE) is characterized by five or more of the following symptoms being present every day, or almost every day, for a minimum of two weeks:[1]Depressed mood for most of the day
Loss of interest or enjoyment in all or most activities
Significant unexplained weight loss or gain, or appetite changes
Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much (hypersomnia)
Restlessness or sluggishness
Tiredness or lack of energy
Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt
Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions
Thoughts of death or suicide – there may be suicide plans or suicide attemptsThese symptoms should indicate a marked difference from the affected person’s previous functioning. For the diagnosis to be made, at least one of the symptoms needs to be depressed mood or loss of interest in most activities. It is also necessary for the symptoms to cause significant distress or impairment in social and job functioning.[1]If the symptoms are attributed to another mental health condition, the diagnosis and treatment may be different to that detailed here for a depressive episode.[1]To rule out any other health conditions that could be causing symptoms of a depressive state, such as a thyroid disorder, a doctor may order blood tests or scans. If a person is considered to be at risk of dementia, the doctor will also check for this condition, as some of the symptoms can be similar to depression.[2]If you think that you might be experiencing depression, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.Minor depressive episodeIf only two to four of the above symptoms are present, instead of major depressive episode, a diagnosis of minor depressive episode may be made. At least one of the symptoms needs to be depressed mood or loss of interest in most activities.[14] This may occur as part of a minor depressive disorder.","Depression is considered to be a treatable condition, with treatment often involving a combination of medication and therapy. Sometimes complementary remedies and lifestyle changes may also be suggested. The treatment program will be tailored according to the severity of the depressive episode, as well as the affected person’s medical history and personal preferences.[2][3][13]PsychotherapyPsychotherapy is talk therapy, and there are several different types that may be effective for people experiencing a mild or moderate depressive episode. These include counseling, problem-solving therapy, interpersonal therapy, group therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) – which can help a person develop more helpful ways of thinking and acting.[12][15]For some people, a combination of psychotherapy and medication may be more effective than psychotherapy alone for depression.[15]MedicationMedication may be prescribed in cases of moderate or severe depression, often in combination with a course of psychotherapy.[2] While the way it works is not yet fully understood, antidepressant medication may alter the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain with a positive impact on mood.[12][15]Several different types of antidepressants are available. The main categories include:[15][16]Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): Typically the first line of treatment,[2] SSRIs tend to cause fewer side-effects than other antidepressants. Examples of SSRIs include fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline.
Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): Similar to SSRIs, but may work better for some people. Examples include venlafaxine and duloxetine.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs): An older type of medication that may cause more side-effects. Generally only prescribed if other treatments do not work, or for other mental health conditions. Examples of TCAs include amitriptyline and imipramine.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): A type of antidepressant usually prescribed when other treatments have not worked or have caused intolerable side-effects, as well as in cases of atypical depression, which has different characteristics to other types of depression. Examples include phenelzine and isocarboxazid. Because MAOIs can interact with certain foods and medications, special care must be taken with this antidepressant.[17]There are also a few other types of antidepressants, such as bupropion and mirtazapine.It may take a few weeks for an antidepressant to take effect and alleviate the symptoms of a depressive episode. A doctor will advise on how long the medication should be taken and what to do if a person wishes to stop taking it. While antidepressants are not considered to be addictive, stopping them suddenly may cause discontinuation symptoms, so the process needs to be managed by a medical practitioner.[15]Some people may experience side-effects while taking antidepressants, including:[15]Nausea and vomiting
Weight gain
Diarrhea or constipation
Feeling sleepy
Sexual problemsWhile less common, other side-effects may include serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition where high levels of serotonin cause mental and physical symptoms like anxiety, rapid heartbeat, high temperature and vomiting,[18] and suicidal thoughts.[15]It may be necessary for a person to try several different medications before finding one that they feel works for them.[15] The type of antidepressants prescribed will depend on the affected person’s age, health and medical history. A doctor will arrange check-ups a couple of weeks after treatment is started and regularly thereafter to monitor progress.[2]Other remediesExercise: Physical activity may be recommended to help with mild to moderate depression, though it is not entirely clear how effective exercise is.[2][3]St John’s Wort: This herbal medicine is sometimes recommended for depressive episodes. However, its efficacy has not been conclusively proven, and it may interact with prescription medications. Prior to taking St John’s Wort, it is advisable to consult a doctor even if taking no other medications, but especially if taking other prescription or over-the-counter medication.[12][15]Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): In this treatment, electrical current is used to stimulate the brain. ECT is typically reserved for depression that is particularly severe or has not responded to other treatments.[12]Light therapy: Bright light therapy has been shown to improve depressive symptoms, both as part of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and non-seasonal major depressive disorder. Light therapy may be helpful on its own or in combination with psychotherapy or antidepressant medication.[19]Acupuncture, spiritual practice and nutritional changes may also be suggested as complementary therapies to help in the treatment of depressive episodes, though there is insufficient scientific evidence to support their efficacy.[3]If the depressive episode is mild, a doctor may suggest waiting for two weeks to see if it clears on its own. In addition, they may recommend self-help resources, relaxation therapies and a small number of psychotherapy sessions. Antidepressants are not usually prescribed for mild depression unless it persists or is causing complications.[2][13]In severe cases of depression, where a person is at risk of harming themselves or others, or is experiencing psychotic symptoms, they may be referred to a specialist care facility.[2]If a person seems in imminent danger of harming themselves, an emergency support provider should be contacted immediately.","Speaking to a healthcare professional and following the treatment program they recommend is very important in managing depressive episodes.While there is no known way to prevent a depressive episode, certain positive behaviors may be helpful. These include:[12]Talking about feelings when upset
Staying active, e.g. exercising and getting outdoors
Eating a balanced diet
Avoiding alcohol and drugs
Writing down factors that may be causing the depression and trying to find solutions","Q: I feel a depressive episode coming on. What can I do to stop it?
A: If you think that you are about to experience a depression flare-up, it is recommended that you speak to a psychotherapist or other qualified healthcare professional. If this is not possible, an online or over-the-phone counseling service may be helpful. See numbers for mental health helplines in the UK and USA and crisis lines in other countries. There is currently no known way to prevent a depressive “attack”, but therapy and/or antidepressant medication may help to manage it. In addition, practicing self-care is recommended. This includes talking about your feelings if you are upset, getting regular exercise, getting outdoors, eating a balanced diet and avoiding alcohol and other intoxicating substances.Q: How long does a depressive episode last?
A: The duration of a depressive episode varies and is influenced by its severity, as well as treatment and individual factors. However, the average length of a depressive episode is thought to be six to eight months.[2]Q: What should I do during a depressive episode?
A: When depression “hits”, many people wonder what they can do to get out of the depressed state. There is no quick remedy for a depressive episode, but it is important to remember that you can take steps to manage it, beginning by speaking to a doctor or psychotherapist, and/or taking antidepressant medication. In addition, practising self-care strategies like getting exercise, eating healthily and avoiding alcohol and drugs is recommended.Q: If a loved one is experiencing a depressive episode, what is the best thing to do?
A: If a friend or partner shows signs of being depressed, the following behaviors may be helpful:[12]Listening without judgment
Spending time with the person
Reassuring them that they can get better
Helping them to eat a balanced diet
Helping them get outside and moving, e.g. by taking them on regular walks or supporting them exercising
Helping them to avoid alcohol
Encouraging them to speak to a healthcare professional
Encouraging them to adhere to their treatment programIt is important to understand that it may take a person experiencing depression a long time to get better. The support of family, friends and broader social networks is an important part of recovery."
Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip,https://ada.com/conditions/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/,,"Babies will usually have no symptoms of hip dysplasia, though it might be possible to see a difference in the length or appearance of their legs, hips and buttocks.

This is usually done by a doctor assessing the movement of the hips, or, increasingly, by ultrasound. X-rays of the hip joint can help to determine hip dysplasia in cases where there is uncertainty.","Hip dysplasia is treated by placing the baby in a harness or brace for a period of a few months to keep the legs in the correct position to allow the hips to form normally.

Diabetes,https://ada.com/conditions/diabetes/,,"The symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes typically include:[12]Excessive thirst
A need to urinate frequently
Excessive hunger
Fatigue or tiredness
Blurred vision
Wounds that are slow to heal
Unexplained weight loss
Tingling and/or pain in the extremitiesThe symptoms of type 1 diabetes typically develop quickly, over a number of days or weeks, while the symptoms of type 2 diabetes typically develop more gradually, normally over months or years. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes may be hard to detect at first and may sometimes be confused with normal signs of aging.For more information on the signs and symptoms of diabetes, take a look at our dedicated page, signs of diabetes. Here you will find information about type 1 and 2 diabetes, as well as the less common types of diabetes.","Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are caused by an insufficiency of insulin. However, what causes this insufficiency differs in each case.Type 1 diabetes is, in most cases, an autoimmune disorder. This means that the immune system, which usually attacks unwanted germs and bacteria, mistakenly attacks healthy cells. In the case of type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. What triggers the immune system to do this is not known, though a popular theory suggests that it may be triggered by a virus.There is also a genetic element to type 1 diabetes. Although it is not a hereditary disorder, if a first-degree relative – a parent or sibling, for example – has the condition, a person stands a greater chance of developing it themselves. In rare cases, type 1 diabetes can also be caused by severe inflammation of the pancreas or the surgical removal of the pancreas.[4][13]Type 2 diabetes is generally caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors. Lifestyle factors include being overweight or obese; eating a diet high in carbohydrates, sugars and fats; and physical inactivity. The likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes also increases significantly if a first-degree relative has experienced the condition.[3]","Diagnosing diabetes will typically involve an evaluation of the symptoms being experienced and a variety of diagnostic tests. These tests may include:[15][16]Random blood glucose test: A reading of 200mg/dL or above will generally indicate diabetes.
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test: A reading of 126mg/dL or above will generally indicate diabetes.
HbA1c test: A reading of 6.5 or above will generally indicate diabetes.
Oral glucose tolerance test: A reading of 200mg/dL or above will generally indicate diabetes.Tests to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, such as a urine ketone test or glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoantibodies tests, may also be necessary.Whichever test is used, it will usually be repeated several times to allow doctors to gain an accurate picture of a person’s blood glucose levels.People displaying symptoms of diabetes should be tested. Moreover, people over the age of 40 should also consider testing, even if they are displaying no symptoms. This is especially true for people within the at-risk groups for type 2 diabetes – people who are overweight or of African, Caribbean or South Asian descent, for example.[15]","There is no cure for diabetes, meaning treatment is aimed at managing blood glucose levels and controlling the symptoms and possible complications of the condition. In the majority of cases, diabetes can be successfully managed.People with type 1 diabetes will usually require regular insulin treatment in order to keep their insulin levels normal. This will typically involve insulin injections, which will be required around two to four times a day. Although some people may use a syringe, in most cases, what is known as an insulin pen or auto-injector will be used. A full explanation of how to administer the insulin will be given upon diagnosis with the condition. Family members or friends may also be taught how to properly do this.[17]The blood glucose levels of people with type 1 diabetes will also need to be regularly checked. This can be done with a home monitoring kit, and can help to determine daily insulin needs. The levels will also be reviewed by doctors to ensure that the overall treatment plan is working effectively.[17]Lifestyle changes are the main method of treatment for type 2 diabetes. This will typically involve:[4][18]Dietary changes: Eating a healthy, balanced diet is key to controlling type 2 diabetes. A dietician will be able to provide guidelines on what to eat, though generally a diet low in fat and high in fibre, fruits and vegetables is recommended.Exercising: Thirty minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five times per week is generally advised for people with type 2 diabetes.Losing weight: If a person with type 2 diabetes is overweight or obese, losing weight can be helpful in reducing blood glucose levels. Dietary changes and exercise can help with this.In many cases, lifestyle changes alone are enough to reduce blood glucose to the target level, leading to remission. However, some people may also require medication. Medications that may be prescribed include metformin, sulfonylurea medicines, nateglinide and repaglinide.[4]","Only type 2 diabetes is preventable. This is because this type of diabetes is commonly caused or exacerbated by unhealthy lifestyle choices.Adopting a healthy, balanced diet is the most important factor in helping to prevent type 2 diabetes. This should be a diet low in carbohydrates, sugar and fat, and high in fruits, vegetables and grains.[19]Other ways to help prevent type 2 diabetes include:[19]Maintaining a healthy weight
Exercising regularly
Not smoking
Minimising alcohol intake",[]
Diabetes Insipidus,https://ada.com/conditions/diabetes-insipidus/,,"Typical symptoms include feeling thirstier than usual, drinking large amounts of water and producing large volumes of urine. Some people produce up to 20 liters of urine a day. Other symptoms include waking up in the middle of the night to urinate (nocturia). People with this condition may become dehydrated if they can't drink enough fluids to replace the water lost in urine. Children may have a fever, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea or weight loss.",[],"The diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms and blood and urine tests. Some specialized tests may be done, such as a water deprivation test, where the amount of urine produced is measured and compared with the amount of water drunk during a given period. MRI scans (magnetic resonance imaging scans) of the brain may be done to investigate the pituitary gland.","The treatment depends on the cause of the diabetes insipidus.

Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2),https://ada.com/conditions/diabetes-mellitus-type-2/,,"The early symptoms are an increased feeling of thirst, frequent urination and the production of large volumes of urine. People with diabetes often feel tired all the time, and may lose weight. Many people, however, do not have any symptoms during the early stages and are diagnosed during routine testing. Later symptoms include frequent infections (for example, skin or bladder infections), slow healing of wounds, blurred vision, and pain or numbness in the feet or hands.",[],"The diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and testing the amount of sugar in the blood. If is unclear if a person has diabetes, the diagnosis is made by undergoing a glucose tolerance test, during which a measured amount of glucose is given, and the levels of sugar in blood are measured over a period of time, to see if the body is taking up the glucose as expected.","The treatment of type 2 diabetes aims to keep blood sugar levels in the normal range, to improve the body's response to insulin and to prevent the development of any complications. The first steps of treatment involve increasing physical exercise, improving the diet and maintaining a healthy weight. However, medications or insulin may become necessary over time to reduce blood sugar levels. As the condition progresses, education about using insulin may be needed, including self-monitoring and managing emergencies. Specialist diabetic educators are helpful in providing information and support at all stages of treatment. Regular follow-up is important in order to detect and prevent consequences, such as eye damage and nerve damage.","Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet and taking regular exercise can help to prevent some cases of type 2 diabetes.",[]
Diaper Rash,https://ada.com/conditions/diaper-rash/,,"It is important to determine whether the skin irritation is mild or severe. Usually, it is fairly easy to make this distinction. One of the first signs of diaper rash is redness in the area that is usually covered by the diaper. In mild cases, this can be a faint pinkness. Other symptoms include the following:Mild diaper rashPink or red patches
A few scattered pimples
Slight scaling and dryness
Stinging sensation when passing urine or fecesSevere diaper rashExtensive redness
Soreness in the area
Pimples
Ulceration
Blisters
Dry, cracked skin
Infant is visibly distressedIn all cases, the skin may feel warm and puffy to the touch. If treated as soon as symptoms become apparent, the rash should clear up quickly and with minimal fuss. Mild cases of diaper rash can usually be treated at home. If the rash is severe, or symptoms persist or worsen, it is important to seek medical help.","There are many different possible causes of diaper rash, and sometimes there is more than one irritant to blame at one time. The following are the most likely causes:[3]Prolonged exposure to urine and feces: The wetness and ammonia can irritate the skin.
Friction (chafing): The diaper may rub against the skin, causing irritation. This often happens when the diaper is too tight or, in older babies, when grains of sand or crumbs get under the diaper while they are playing or eating.
Sensitive skin: Conditions like eczema and seborrheic dermatitis may increase the risk of a baby developing diaper rash. However, these conditions are usually not limited to the diaper area.
Intolerance to a product: The skin may react to one of the ingredients in a new product, such as baby wipes, lotions, soaps, different brands of disposable diapers, and detergents and softeners used on cloth diapers.
New foods in the diet: Diaper rash often develops when a baby starts eating solid foods. The content and frequency of their stools can change, causing skin irritation. Breast-fed infants can also develop diaper rash in reaction to something their mother has eaten.
Yeast or bacterial infection: The warmth and moisture of the diaper area make it susceptible to bacteria and yeast (candida) infections. The creases of the skin are particularly vulnerable and may become red, with scattered red dots nearby.
Antibiotics: By killing good bacteria along with the bad, antibiotics – whether taken by an infant or their breastfeeding mother – can upset the balance of the skin flora. Yeast infections can develop as a result. Antibiotics can also cause diarrhea, which irritates the skin.If the diaper rash does not go away despite resolution of the suspected causes, a doctor’s opinion should be sought to identify the triggers, treat the rash, and prevent it from recurring or worsening.","Doctors usually diagnose diaper rashes by taking a history and conducting a physical examination. Unless they suspect an allergy or rare deficiency, they are unlikely to perform laboratory tests.[4]A medical practitioner will be able to differentiate diaper rash from other skin conditions such as eczema and seborrheic dermatitis, and advise on the best course of action. In the case of mild diaper rash, a home diagnosis is usually made by caregivers, based on the symptoms presented by the infant.","Mild cases of diaper rash can be treated at home, without a visit to the doctor or special medications. Taking simple steps to improve the infant’s skin care will usually clear the rash.Home remedies for diaper rashLeave the diaper off for as long as possible. This will allow the area to air-dry and aid healing. You can lay the infant on an absorbent towel if necessary.Change diapers frequently, including at night.
Clean the skin with warm water, using a gentle, fragrance-free soap if necessary. Avoid wipes, as these can be irritating. Take care not to rub too hard, and always wipe the genital area from front to back.
After cleaning, pat the skin dry with a soft cloth or allow it to air-dry.
Bathe the infant no more than twice a day to stop the skin drying out.
Avoid baby powders as they can aggravate the inflammation.
Gently apply a barrier cream or ointment after diaper changes. This will reduce the contact between skin and waste products, helping to prevent further irritation. Zinc cream, zinc oxide and petroleum jelly are all options. Natural alternatives, such as creams containing marigold extract, are available too. A pharmacist will be able to advise on which product to use.[2]
Ensure that the diaper is not too tight.
Try a different brand of diaper to see if it might help.
Use fragrance-free, hypoallergenic detergents and softeners when washing cloth diapers and baby clothing.
Introduce new foods slowly to see whether there is a connection.[5]
If a food item seems to be problematic, remove it from the baby’s diet for a few days and reintroduce it slowly, checking for a reaction.Diaper rash that won’t go awayIf the rash is severe, persists or worsens despite the above interventions, it is advisable to consult a pharmacist or doctor. If there are any signs of pus, bleeding or fever, medical care should be sought immediately.A doctor may prescribe a special treatment for the rash. This could include a mild hydrocortisone (steroid) cream, an antifungal ointment, and topical or oral antibiotics (in the case of bacterial infections). Hydrocortisone creams should only be used if deemed necessary by a doctor, as they can cause additional problems.[6]If the rash does not respond to any of these treatments, the doctor may refer the infant to a specialist to get to the bottom of the problem.","Diaper rash can often be prevented by practicing what is known as good diaper care. This involves keeping three keywords in mind – clean, dry and apply[7] – and taking the following steps:[1]Change diapers as soon after soiling as possible to reduce skin exposure to urine and feces.
Clean the diaper area thoroughly with warm water alone, using a gentle, fragrance-free soap only where absolutely necessary. Use soft cloths or cotton balls and wipe gently. If you are using baby wipes, make sure they are mild and alcohol-free.
Dry the skin by patting it with a clean towel, or allow the diaper area to air-dry.
Avoid talcum powder, cornstarch and other drying powders, as these can cause both skin and lung irritation.
Apply a barrier ointment regularly to protect the skin.
Check that the diaper is not too tight.
Wash your hands with soap after changing the diaper to prevent the spread of germs.
Set aside periods where the diaper can be left off for a while.
When the infant starts taking a course of antibiotics, pre-empt diaper rash by applying barrier creams.","Q: Can adults get diaper rash?
A: Yes, diaper rash can affect adults too. Anyone who wears diapers or incontinence briefs can develop diaper rash, regardless of their age. They may notice pain, swelling and redness around the genitals. The causes and treatments of diaper rash in adults are similar to those in infants.It is important to check that the diapers or briefs fit well to minimize friction, and ensure that they are changed often so that moisture is not left to accumulate. The genital area must be cleaned and dried properly at each change. To avoid causing further irritation, warm water and a fragrance-free, alcohol free cleanser should be used. A mild repair cream can provide relief. Hydrocortisone and antibiotic ointments should not be applied unless prescribed by a doctor. Patients can also increase their fluid intake to dilute their urine, making it less irritating to the skin.If there are any signs of infection, such as blisters, pus, or fever, the rash spreads to other parts of the body, or the rash does not go away in three to four days, the afflicted adult should seek medical advice. Persistent or frequent diaper rash in adults may be a sign of neglect or abuse.[8]Q: Can you use diaper rash cream for acne?
A: Some people claim to have used diaper rash cream to treat their facial pimples and acne, touting the protective properties of zinc oxide for the skin. However, medical practitioners do not recommend using dedicated diaper rash creams for anything other than the treatment of diaper rash. Off-label use, particularly of products containing hydrocortisone, could cause contact dermatitis and actually worsen acne.[9] It is advisable to consult a dermatologist about appropriate treatments for acne.Q: Is diaper rash related to teething in babies?
A: In the past, diaper rash was often thought to be related to teething in babies. Many caregivers believed that teething could lead to loose stools and result in diaper rash. However, modern studies have found that teething is not typically a cause of diaper rash.[10] If your child is showing symptoms of diaper rash, the condition should be treated as outlined above."
Disseminated Tuberculosis,https://ada.com/conditions/disseminated-tuberculosis/,,"Symptoms depend upon the organ system infected with the bacteria. Common general symptoms of tuberculosis include fever and chills, night sweats, feeling generally unwell, joint pain, weight loss, tiredness, pale skin, swollen lymph nodes, a cough and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include bone pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain and swelling, or blood in the urine.People who may be experiencing symptoms linked to disseminated tuberculosis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",[],"The diagnosis of disseminated (widespread) tuberculosis can be difficult. Although the diagnosis may be suspected based on the symptoms in a person who is at risk of tuberculosis, it can only be confirmed with tests to confirm a tuberculosis infection. Often several tests are needed. These may include X-rays or scans looking for tuberculosis infection in the lungs or other organs, a skin or blood test for evidence of exposure to the bacteria in the past, and, in some cases, taking a sample of the infected organ and testing it for the presence of the bacteria.","Disseminated tuberculosis is treated with a combination of antibiotics. This is the same treatment for tuberculosis in the lungs, but usually needs a longer course of antibiotics. It may take 6 to 12 months to completely treat the infection.","People who are traveling to areas with tuberculosis can be vaccinated against tuberculosis, or should be tested for tuberculosis infection when they return. People who have a tuberculosis infection should take the entire course of antibiotics to completely treat the infection.",[]
Diverticulitis,https://ada.com/conditions/diverticulitis/,,"Many people with diverticular disease do not have symptoms until they develop diverticulitis. Typical symptoms include changes in bowel habits (alternating diarrhea and constipation), bloating, nausea, vomiting and belly pain. If the diverticula are infected and inflamed, they may cause fever, belly pain and blood and pus in the stool. Symptoms are due to inflammation, irritation and sometimes infections forming in the out-pouching of the bowel.",[],The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of medical history and physical examination. A computed tomography (CT) scan may be needed to identify the location of the inflammation in the bowel and confirm the diagnosis.,"Treatment is based on the severity and stage of diverticular disease. Affected people with no symptoms usually do not need treatment. People who have diverticulitis (infection and inflammation of the pouches) may receive antibiotics to treat the infection. In severe or complicated cases, surgery might be needed to stop bleeding, drain pus, or even remove parts of the bowel. However this is very uncommon.",Eating foods which are high in fiber may help prevent diverticular disease and episodes of inflammation of the pouches (diverticulitis).,[]
Dry Eye Syndrome,https://ada.com/conditions/dry-eye-syndrome/,,"The symptoms of dry eye syndrome are mild in most instances; however, even mild but persistent symptoms can be extremely troublesome and difficult to treat. The symptoms of dry eye syndrome usually affect both eyes.Common symptoms include:[3]Dry, gritty and sore eyes
Irritation and redness of the eyes
Temporarily blurred vision (which will usually improve after blinking)
A feeling of tired or strained eyesIf any of the symptoms of dry eye syndrome persist or cause serious pain, medical attention should be sought.","Tears are composed of a mixture of oil, water and mucus – a combination that ensures the surface of the eyes remain smooth and clear, as well as protecting the eyes from infection.[4] Dry eye syndrome is caused when the glands of the eyes are unable create an adequate amount of tears, when tears evaporate too rapidly or when there is an imbalance in the composition of tears.Deficiency of tearsOne common cause of dry eye syndrome is an inability of the glands in the eyes to produce enough tears to keep them moist. Typical reasons for this include:[5]Medical conditions including diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, lupus, Sjögren syndrome, thyroid disorders and vitamin A deficiency
Aging
Certain medications including decongestants; antihistamines; hormone replacement therapy; antidepressants; medications used to treat high blood pressure, acne and Parkinson’s disease; as well as birth control drugs
Laser eye surgery (this effect is usually temporary)
Damage to the tear glands from inflammation or radiationEvaporation of tearsAnother common cause of dry eye syndrome is the evaporation of tears at an increased rate. Causes of this can include:Dry, windy or smoky environments
Blinking less often (typically when reading, driving or concentrating intensely)
Problems with the eyelids such as ectropion (out-turning of the eyelids) or entropion (in-turning of the eyelids)Imbalance in tear compositionThe tear film that coats the eyes is composed of three substances, each with a different role within the eye:[6]An oily outer layer (lipid) produced by the meibomian glands which prevents tears from evaporating too quickly.
A watery middle layer (aqueous) produced by the tear glands which helps nourish the cornea and the conjunctiva.
A mucous inner layer produced by goblet cells which helps bind water to the eyes, helping them to stay moist.Dry eye syndrome can result from problems with any one of these layers. For example, the meibomian glands can become blocked, resulting in decreased production of oils or the production of lower-quality oils.[7]","Those experiencing any of the symptoms of dry eye syndrome – dryness, irritation, blurred vision, etc. – should visit a doctor or ophthalmologist as soon as possible. Based on the symptoms, tests may be done to assess the severity of the symptoms and dryness.Tests include:[8]Fluorescein eye test: Fluorescent eye drops are used to highlight the tears in the eyes, enabling a specialist to monitor how tears are being produced and how quickly they are evaporating. The drops may also show any damage to the surface of the eye.
Schirmer’s test: Blotting paper is placed over the lower eyelids and left for five minutes. The wetness of the paper determines the diagnosis, with less than 10 mm indicating the presence of dry eye syndrome.
Lissamine green test: A strip of paper containing a special dye is placed over the surface of the eyes, allowing specialists to identify any damage to the surface of the eye.","After being diagnosed with dry eye syndrome, a specialist will recommend a treatment route appropriate to the underlying cause, the specific symptoms and the severity of the condition. There is no cure for dry eye syndrome, but it can be effectively managed.Treatment may involve:[9]Eye drops: Drops to artificially increase the moisture in the eyes is the most common treatment option. These may be prescribed by a specialist but are also available over the counter.
Medication: The most common drug used to combat chronic dry eye syndrome caused by ocular inflammation is cyclosporine. This anti-inflammatory medication is given as eye drops and helps to increase tear production by the tear glands.
Medication change: If a medication used to treat another condition is identified as the cause of dry eye syndrome, a doctor may prescribe an alternative.
Surgery: Surgical treatment is reserved for severe cases of dry eye syndrome. The procedure will usually involve blocking the tear drainage holes in the inner eye using lacrimal (punctal) plugs. This is reversible but can be used as a permanent solution.","Prevention of dry eye syndrome may involve regulating environmental conditions and making small lifestyle changes. Avoiding dry climates and using a humidifier to increase the moisture in the air can be effective, as can avoiding smokey and windy conditions. Taking frequent time out while driving, using a computer or reading can help to refresh the tear film and prevent the eyes from drying out.","Q: Are there any home remedies for dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca)?
A: Yes, there are a number of home remedies for dry eye syndrome. These include:[10]Warm compresses: Irritation can be reduced and the meibomian glands declogged through the application of a warm compress. This treatment consists of wetting a cloth with warm water, placing it over the eyes and gently dabbing the corners of the eyes. This may be necessary every day.
Hygiene: Keeping the eyelids and areas surrounding the eyes (including the lashes) clean can help prevent dry eye syndrome and ease the condition’s symptoms. A small amount of mild cleanser or shampoo can be used to clean this area. Avoiding excessive touching of the eyes can also help keep the eyes clean.
Hydration: A person can stay hydrated by drinking large amounts (8 to 10 glasses daily) of water. This can help the eyes stay moist.
Diet and supplements: A deficiency of certain proteins and vitamins may in some cases contribute to the onset or the severity of dry eye syndrome. In these cases, foods rich in Omega-3 and supplements containing Omega-3 may be recommended as a treatment option. Consuming foods high in flaxseed oil (such as pasta and cereals) or flaxseed oil supplements can also help ease the symptoms of the condition.If symptoms persist despite the use of any home remedy, or if any adverse effects result, medical attention should be sought promptly.Q: Should I be worried about blurred vision as a result of dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca)?
A: Temporarily blurred vision can be a symptom of dry eye syndrome. Typically, it is little more than an inconvenience and can be managed through various treatment options. However, those who experience blurred vision should seek medical attention, as, in rare cases, it can be a symptom of more serious conditions such as eye disease.[11]Q: What can I do when my eyes feel dry?
A: If your eyes begin to feel dry during activities such as driving, reading or using a computer, it is a good idea to take frequent breaks to allow the tear film to refresh. You should also remember to blink frequently. Laying a damp cloth over your eyes may also be effective in re-moisturising the eyes.Q: Is there a surgical method of treatment for dry eye syndrome (Keratoconjunctivitis sicca)?
A: Yes, a minor, non-invasive surgical procedure to insert lacrimal (punctal) plugs can be used to treat dry eye syndrome. These plugs are small devices which are placed into the opening of the tear ducts in the eyes. Lacrimal plugs work by blocking the drainage of tears from the eyes, keeping them lubricated. Lacrimal plugs will generally only be recommended once other treatment methods have proven unsuccessful.[12]Q: What is the relationship between dry eye syndrome and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)
A: MGD is among the leading causes of dry eye syndrome. The condition occurs when the glands responsible for the oily layer of the tear film (located inside the eyelids, with their openings on the edge of the eyelids) cease to function, preventing the oily component of tears from being released and causing the watery component of tears to dry out more quickly. There exists several treatment methods for MGD.[13]Q: What is the relationship between dry eye syndrome and Sjögren syndrome?
A: Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder which has as its principal symptoms a dryness of the eyes and mouth. As such, Sjögren syndrome is one of the leading causes of dry eye syndrome."

Ectopic Pregnancy,https://ada.com/conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/,,"If symptoms of ectopic pregnancy occur, they typically appear early on in the pregnancy, sometimes before a person realizes they are pregnant.Early signs of ectopic pregnancyThe most common early signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include:[2][3][4]Lower abdominal (stomach) pain. Ectopic pregnancy pain is often located on one side of the body
Vaginal bleeding, which may be dark, watery and heavier, lighter or more prolonged than a normal period
Pregnancy symptoms such as a missed menstrual period, breast tenderness, frequent urination or nauseaHowever, it is possible to have an ectopic pregnancy without any of the above symptoms.If you are concerned that you may have an ectopic pregnancy, you can use the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.Other signs of ectopic pregnancyLess common symptoms include:Bowel and bladder problems, such as diarrhea, and pain when defecating or urinating
A feeling of fullness when lying down that is not associated with eating, particularly in people who have already had a child
Back painIt is possible to have an ectopic pregnancy without experiencing any symptoms until rupture of the fallopian tube or close organs. After rupture, signs and symptoms may include:[3]Severe abdominal (tummy) pain
Vaginal bleeding
Lightheadedness, sometimes followed by fainting
Shoulder pain, described as a strange pain that feels different to any pain that a person has otherwise experienced, located at the tip of the shoulder, where it joins the arm, caused by internal bleedingIf you are concerned that you may have an ectopic pregnancy, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.","When a person becomes pregnant, the sperm and the egg (ovum) join in the fallopian tube, the tube that carries the ovum from the ovary to the uterus. Usually, the fertilized egg passes along the fallopian tube and into the uterus and implants into the lining of the uterus (endometrium),  where it will grow and develop.Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants and starts to grow outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. This is often due to scarring from previous infections or other abnormalities in the tube’s shape, for instance a birth defect.As the ectopic pregnancy gets bigger, it can run out of space to grow and rupture the fallopian tube, causing severe pain and internal bleeding. Rarely, an ectopic pregnancy can also occur in other places, such as the ovary or inside the abdomen.","Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy usually begins with a physical exam and taking the person’s medical history. A person may be referred to a gynecology clinic for further assessment.Ectopic pregnancies are most commonly diagnosed using a combination of tests, including:Ultrasound
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test
Laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) if the previous exam results are still ambiguousGood to know: Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy can be delayed because the symptoms are often similar to other, more well-known conditions, such as gastroenteritis, appendicitis or miscarriage. See this resource for more information about the signs of miscarriage.Ectopic pregnancy ultrasoundUltrasound is an imaging technique which uses soundwaves to create an image of the developing pregnancy. It is a painless and non-invasive procedure which can be performed in two different ways:[8]Transvaginally: A scanning probe is inserted into the vagina.
Transabdominally: Gel is spread onto the skin of the lower abdomen, and the scanner is passed over the area.In diagnosing an ectopic pregnancy, doctors will look for where the pregnancy is located in the ultrasound images. These can help them determine whether the person’s symptoms are being caused by an ectopic pregnancy, a healthy pregnancy or another condition. Ultrasound indicators for ectopic pregnancy include:[9]No pregnancy in the uterus, or a gestation sac in the uterus missing an embryo: This is a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL). This is a label given until the pregnancy location can be found, and a diagnosis can be given. Many of these will not be ectopic and will not need treatment.
No pregnancy in the uterus and a possible mass in the area of a fallopian tube: This would likely lead to diagnosis of a possible ectopic pregnancy.hCG test for ectopic pregnancyHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta, an organ that develops in the womb during pregnancy. A beta hCG blood test can detect hCG in the blood approximately 11 days after conception and establish the precise amount of hCG present. This might be used if a person has been pregnant for six weeks, but an ultrasound scan does not show a developing pregnancy in the uterus. The test may be repeated at intervals to measure changes in hCG levels.[10]Possible indicators for ectopic pregnancy from a beta hCG blood test include:[11]Declining hCG levels: This can be an indicator that the ectopic pregnancy has ended and is self-resolving or will be miscarried in the coming days or weeks.
Slow rising hCG levels: If the levels rise more slowly than in a normal pregnancy, it is likely that the pregnancy is ectopic.In a healthy pregnancy, hCG levels in the blood double about every two to four days throughout the first trimester, reaching their peak after 8-11 weeks and then decreasing before plateauing during the second trimester.Laparoscopic diagnosis of ectopic pregnancyRarely, laparoscopy, a type of keyhole surgery, is used to confirm the diagnosis, if hCG and ultrasound results are ambiguous. Under general anesthetic, a laparoscope (a narrow instrument with a camera and light on the end) is inserted through a small cut, usually into the umbilicus (belly button), to look at the pelvis. If an ectopic pregnancy is found, treatment to remove it may take place during the same operation.[3]","An ectopic pregnancy can be life threatening if left untreated and normally requires medical or surgical intervention to remove it. However, in some cases, when it is diagnosed early, ectopic pregnancy may be monitored to see if it will resolve on its own.Treatment options depend on:[12]hCG levels
How many weeks pregnant the affected person is
Size and impact of the ectopic pregnancy as shown on an ultrasound
Pain levels
General health
The options the hospital has available
Personal views and preferences, such as future pregnancy plansExpectant management for ectopic pregnancyAlso known as conservative or wait-and-see management, expectant management involves waiting to see if the ectopic pregnancy tissue passes out of the cervix on its own, instead of undergoing immediate treatment.Expectant management is only offered as an option in some cases of very early diagnosis. Candidates for expectant management of ectopic pregnancy should:[13]Be asymptomatic
Show signs that the ectopic pregnancy is resolving, such as declining beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) levels
Not show signs of rupture
Not show signs of hemodynamic instability (abnormal blood pressure)
Have easy access to a hospital and be prepared to continue with follow-up
Be willing to accept the potential risks of tubal ruptureThe approach involves close monitoring by medical professionals through repeated blood tests to check that hCG levels are dropping. It can take a few weeks or sometimes months for this to happen. About half of ectopic pregnancies may resolve on their own where there is a drop in hCG levels.If a person develops new symptoms, another ultrasound scan may be done, and treatment options will be reassessed. Medical or surgical intervention may be required if it does not complete as planned.[14]Medical management with methotrexate for ectopic pregnancySometimes, an ectopic pregnancy may be treated with a medication called methotrexate. This stops the growth of the embryo and typically allows surgery to be avoided. Medical management may be suitable if a diagnosis has been made very early.Treatment with methotrexate is an especially attractive option if the pregnancy is located in the cervix or ovary or in the interstitial or the cornual portion of the tube. Surgical treatment in these cases is often associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage.Methotrexate is administered as an injection, usually a single shot into the buttock muscle. After the injection, there may be an overnight stay in hospital, and regular follow-up visits will be needed for a few weeks to monitor hCG levels until they return to normal. Some people will need a second injection of methotrexate. Very occasionally, surgery will still be required.Apart from being used as a medication for ectopic pregnancy, methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug and immune system suppressant used to treat a variety of other conditions. It can cause significant side-effects. However, the dose to treat ectopic pregnancy is much lower and is unlikely to cause severe problems.[12] Some pain is likely in the first few days after the injection, but this can usually be controlled with paracetamol. Certain substances should be avoided during treatment, including:[3]Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g. ibuprofen or naprosyn, as they can interact with methotrexate and reduce its effectiveness
Alcoholic beverages, as the liver will be working hard to metabolise methotrexate
Supplements containing folic acid, as this can interact with methotrexate, preventing it from achieving the desired effectEctopic pregnancy removal with surgeryThere are two possible aims for surgical management, which will be decided depending on damage to the affected fallopian tube and the condition of the other tube. These are:[12][13]Total salpingectomy: This involves removal of the tube containing the ectopic pregnancy and is normally recommended for people who either do not want to have any children in future, who have had another ectopic pregnancy in the same fallopian tube, or who have severely damaged tubes. This reduces the risk of a persistent ectopic pregnancy, in which some ectopic cells are left behind and continue to grow, or further ectopic pregnancies. Total salpingectomy may also be chosen in cases of uncontrolled bleeding and hemodynamic instability (abnormal blood pressure).
Linear salpingostomy: This is a more conservative approach, involving a surgical incision into a fallopian tube, which aims to remove the ectopic pregnancy without removing the tube. This is normally recommended for people who have an unruptured ectopic pregnancy in the ampullary (middle) portion of the tube. This may also be chosen if the person only has one tube, or their other tube does not seem to be healthy. It carries a higher risk of future ectopic pregnancy and persistent ectopic pregnancy, but still leaves the possibility of a future uterine pregnancy. However, salpingostomy is not always possible.The operation will be performed under general anesthetic in one of two ways:Laparoscopy: This is keyhole surgery involving minimal incisions. Recovery is about two to four weeks, though this varies from person to person.
Laparotomy: This is open surgery, which is used if severe internal bleeding is suspected. It involves a larger incision in the lower abdomen. Recovery is about four to six weeks, though this varies from person to person.",[],"Q: How common is ectopic pregnancy?
A: About one in 50 pregnancies are ectopic.[16] Many early ectopic pregnancies resolve on their own, without treatment. Some ectopic pregnancies will resolve before they produce symptoms.Q: Can a person have an ectopic pregnancy with a copper coil (IUD)?
A: IUDs ensure a very low risk of any pregnancy, either intrauterine or ectopic. However, if a person does conceive, the probability of the pregnancy being ectopic is higher than in women not using an IUD.[3] An IUD is still more protective against ectopic pregnancy than not using contraception.[16]Q: Can a person have an ectopic pregnancy with IVF?
A: Yes, in vitro fertilization puts a person at higher risk of ectopic pregnancy. It may increase the occurrence of unusual types of ectopic pregnancies, such as heterotopic (simultaneous intrauterine and tubal pregnancies) and interstitial pregnancy.[17]Q: Is it possible to miscarry an ectopic pregnancy?
A: In the very early stages, the fetus may pass out of the cervix on its own, without the need for further treatment (expectant management). This may result in some symptoms of miscarriage being present. As the fetus develops, it becomes less likely that it will pass out of the womb on its own, and medical or surgical management will be needed to remove it. However, the techniques used to treat ectopic pregnancy may differ from those used to treat incomplete miscarriage. See this resource on miscarriage for more information.Q: Is prevention of ectopic pregnancy possible?
A: Preventing ectopic pregnancy is not normally possible. Adequate use of contraceptives significantly reduces the risk of ectopic pregnancy. A person may be able to prevent a tubal pregnancy in the fallopian tube, if things that scar the tube, such as smoking and exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), can be avoided.In some cases of ectopic pregnancy, a person may have surgery to remove the tube containing the ectopic pregnancy, which will reduce the risk of further ectopic pregnancies or  persistent ectopic pregnancy; this occurs if some ectopic cells are left behind and continue to grow."

Endocarditis,https://ada.com/conditions/endocarditis/,,"Symptoms of endocarditis may include:[4]Fever and chills
Fatigue and night sweats
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Generally feeling unwell
Pain in the muscles or joints
Shortness of breath and coughing
Chest pain when breathing
Swelling of the legs, ankles or feetLess common symptoms may include:Blood in the urine
Tenderness in the upper half of the abdomen
Red spots on the hands or feet
Red-purple bumps under the skin of the toes or fingers (Osler’s nodes)
Small red or purple spots on the skin, inside the mouth or on the whites of the eyes
Back painNon-infective endocarditis will generally present fewer symptoms than infective endocarditis
and they are unlikely to develop until the later stages of the condition or when complications
arise. Symptoms of infective endocarditis can either develop slowly or rapidly (in a number
of days) depending on what kind of bacteria or fungi is causing the condition.Complications can develop quickly, making the condition more difficult to treat. For this
reason, it is important to see a doctor early when worrying symptoms occur.","Endocarditis most often occurs in people with preexisting heart disease (which may be
diagnosed or undiagnosed) and less commonly in people with normal hearts.Endocarditis may occur when bacteria or fungi enter the bloodstream through small injuries
(such as those experienced during teeth cleaning), when injecting into the veins, during
surgery, or as a result of other infections. If the bacteria or fungi reach the heart, they
may settle on the endocardium (the heart’s inner lining or valves) and begin to grow – causing
an infection.Ordinarily, the immune system is able to clear bacteria and fungi that enters the bloodstream.
When this does not happen, however, some bacteria or fungi can settle on the endocardium or
valves of the heart (especially likely if a valve is already damaged in some way) and form
small growths (vegetations). These growths can prevent the heart from functioning correctly
and may break off and infect other areas of the body.While endocarditis is a rare condition, the following groups are most at risk:[5]People with previously damaged heart valves or an artificial heart valve
Users of injected drugs such as heroinIt should also be noted that any procedure that requires placing medical devices into the
veins or any type of heart surgery can also be a risk factor.Those most at risk of non-infective endocarditis include people with the following conditions:[6]Systemic lupus erythematosus
Antiphospholipid syndrome
Stomach, lung or pancreatic cancer","If a diagnosis of endocarditis is suspected based on the symptoms and medical history, a
thorough physical examination will be carried out, paying particular attention to the heart.[7]
In particular, doctor’s will listen for heart murmurs (unusual sounds from the heart), which
can be an indicator of the condition. A doctor will in most cases then also order a series
of tests to confirm the diagnosis.Blood tests will be ordered in order to identify any bacteria or fungi present in the blood.
An ultrasound of the heart may also be able to show signs of any abnormal growths on the
heart valve, as well as any damage to the heart. Further diagnostic tests (X ray, CT, MRI,
ECG) can also be carried out to investigate any involvement in other organs .[8]If blood tests reveal no sign of infection but other symptoms and risk factors are present,
the diagnosis of non-infective endocarditis may still be possible.[9]","Many cases of (infective) endocarditis can be effectively treated with antibiotics or
antifungal medication. If the growth is very large, or if there is new or pre-existing
damage to the heart, surgery may be required.[10]AntibioticsAs soon as possible after diagnosis, an individual with infective endocarditis will be treated
with antibiotics, usually intravenously (through a drip). The course will last for several
weeks, a period through which most people will be required to stay in hospital.If an individual continues to feel unwell after a number of days of treatment using antibiotics,
or if new symptoms occur, it is important to inform a doctor.SurgeryIf the endocarditis causes severe damage to the heart, or infections are persistent, surgery
may be necessary. The goal is generally repair a damaged valve or replace a valve entirely.
Surgery can be life-saving, but it is a risky procedure with possible complications.Treating non-infective endocarditisTreatment for non-infective endocarditis generally involves treating the underlying condition
that is its cause. Drugs to prevent the formation of new blood clots may be prescribed, but
this will depend on the doctor and the underlying causes of the condition.[11]","To help prevent endocarditis, it is important – especially for those who are particularly vulnerable
to the disorder – to be aware of its signs and symptoms. Through this awareness, if any signs or
symptoms occur, it will be possible to seek medical assistance without delay.It is also important to maintain high standards of dental hygiene and to receive regular checkups
from a dentist. This will help prevent any bacteria from the mouth passing into the bloodstream.
Individuals should also avoid getting tattoos and piercings – activities that can lead to infection.People with a known high risk of developing endocarditis may also be given preventative antibiotics
before dental or medical procedures. This decision, however, is left to the discretion of the doctor
or dentist.[12]Users of injected drugs (such as heroin) should use only sterile syringes, needles and other apparatus,
and never share syringes with others in order to reduce the risk of infection.","Q: What is the prognosis for endocarditis?
A: The prognosis for endocarditis can be significantly improved if the condition is detected early and treatment begun quickly. If left untreated, the condition can be life-threatening. In cases of non-infective endocarditis, the prognosis depends on the severity of the symptoms and the cause of the condition.Q: When should I seek medical attention for suspected endocarditis?
A: People who have an ongoing fever, chills and shortness of breath, or who have any other worrisome symptoms, should see a doctor for review of these symptoms. Those at higher risk of the condition (people with a damaged heart, those who have had a valve repair or replacement or injected drug users) should make themselves aware of the symptoms and see a doctor as soon as any of these they occur.Q: Can I receive preventative treatment for endocarditis?
A: People at high risk of contracting endocarditis may be given preventative treatment, which will usually take the form of antibiotics to help the body combat a possible infection. People with a damaged heart, heart disease and users of injected drugs should consult a doctor about the possibility of using preventive treatment methods. A doctor will be able to assess the probability of endocarditis and explain the options from there. Preventative measures may be particularly important before surgical and dental procedures.[15]"
Endometrial Cancer,https://ada.com/conditions/endometrial-cancer/,,"The most common symptom is bleeding from the vagina after menopause. This might appear as spontaneous bleeding, or bleeding after sexual intercourse. Women who have not been through menopause may notice bleeding between periods. Other symptoms include pain felt low in the abdomen, or low belly pain during sexual intercourse.",[],Diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms and an ultrasound of the uterus. A tissue sample of the cancer (a biopsy) is taken and investigated to confirm the diagnosis.,"Treatment of uterine cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The combination of these factors determines the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, endometrial cancer can be treated by radiation therapy, surgery to remove the uterus, chemotherapy, or a combination of therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment.",The use of the oral contraceptive pill (the pill) may help to prevent some cases of endometrial cancer. Giving up smoking and reducing alcohol intake may also be helpful.,[]
Endometrial Polyps,https://ada.com/conditions/endometrial-polyps/,,"Common symptoms of endometrial polyps include:[1][2]Irregular menstrual bleeding: Menstrual bleeding that is shorter or longer in length than usual, or that occurs at unexpected times
Spotting or bleeding between menstrual periods
Unusually heavy bleeding during periods
Unusual appearance of brown blood after a menstrual period
Spotting or bleeding after menopause
Spotting or bleeding after sexual intercourse
Severe menstrual cramping, though this is uncommon
InfertilityMany of these symptoms do not arise from the formation of the polyp itself, but because of rubbing and irritation of the surrounding tissue. Most endometrial polyps are small, and many people who experience them will never develop symptoms. Pain is not a typical symptom of uterine polyps.[3]People experiencing possible symptoms of endometrial polyps should seek medical attention. In addtion, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.","Endometrial polyps are caused by the overgrowth of endometrial tissue, which is the lining of the uterus that swells and then shrinks during the menstrual cycle. Endometrial polyps are estrogen-sensitive, with hormones in the bloodstream playing a role in their occurrence.[2][4]Risk factorsWomen over 40 who have not experienced menopause, and those who have had children, are considered to be at greater risk of developing endometrial polyps. Other risk factors include:[1][2][5][6]Going through perimenopause
Hormone replacement therapy after menopause, particularly where the dose of estrogen is high
Obesity
Treatment with the medication tamoxifen for breast cancer, after menopauseEndometrial polyps may recur. People who have had polyps in the past are somewhat more likely to develop them in the future, compared to those who have never had them.[1][3]People worried about developing endometrial polyps can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.","Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is the first-line method for evaluating women with abnormal vaginal bleeding. During a TVUS, a thin, wand-like device is placed inside the vagina and uterus, where it emits ultrasonic waves. The doctor may be able to identify a uterine polyp by examining this ultrasound.[2]If the ultrasound finding is uncertain, there are two other options. One is where the physician carries out a more specialized ultrasound, called a sonohysterography or a saline infusion sonogram (SIS). In this procedure, the doctor injects a small amount of saline into the uterus to expand the uterine cavity and provide a clearer picture.[2]The second option, should a TVUS be uncertain, is a hysteroscopy. This allows a more direct view of the inside of the uterus, using a hysteroscope: a lighted camera mounted on a flexible rod. The hysteroscope may be equipped with an additional tool to gather a biopsy sample. A suction catheter could also be used to gather an endometrial biopsy. The tissue sample will then be analyzed to see if it indicates uterine cancer.[2]","Small, asymptomatic polyps in people before menopause often require no treatment, but will instead be monitored for changes or an increase in symptoms.[2]A short-term option to address the symptoms of endometrial polyps is the use of hormonal treatments, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and progestins. However, since symptoms usually recur once treatment is stopped, this is not the preferred long-term treatment option.[2]Uterine polyp removal, called polypectomy, which is carried out using a hysteroscopy, is the standard procedure. The doctor uses a camera attached to a long, thin tube to examine the interior of the uterus, locate the polyp and then remove it with an integrated wire loop or blade. It is typically screened for cancer.[3]The removal of small endometrial polyps using hysteroscopy can sometimes be done as an outpatient procedure at a doctor’s office, but removing large polyps may require a hospital stay. Many people are able to return to normal activities within the next few days. Side-effects of uterine polyp removal may include light spotting.[3]Preventing endometrial polyp recurrenceIn most cases, endometrial polyps do not recur after they have been removed by polypectomy.[1] If they do recur, a repeat polypectomy procedure may be recommended.If a person is concerned, an intrauterine device (IUD) can be inserted into the uterus to help prevent a recurrence of uterine polyps. This contraceptive may be a good choice for those who hope to maintain their fertility.[1] Endomyometrial resection (EMR) – the surgical removal of around 5 mm of the uterine lining and some underlying muscle tissue – is another option, though this is a complex procedure and may not be appropriate for everyone. It is typically only recommended for people who do not wish to have children.[7]","In most cases, endometrial polyps do not recur after they have been removed by polypectomy.[1] If they do recur, a repeat polypectomy procedure may be recommended.If a person is concerned, an intrauterine device (IUD) can be inserted into the uterus to help prevent a recurrence of uterine polyps.

A: Roughly 95 percent of the time, endometrial polyps are benign (noncancerous), but in about five percent of cases they are linked to cancer. If uterine polyps can develop into cancer, they are called precancerous. Among people with endometrial polyps, those presenting with bleeding and those older than 50 are more likely to have cancerous endometrial polyps.[3][9]Q: How are endometrial polyps different from uterine fibroids (leiomyoma)?
A: Endometrial polyps are formed from the lining of the uterus and therefore only occur within the uterine cavity. Fibroids come from the uterine musculature and may arise on any part of the uterus interior, exterior or the uterine wall. Uterine polyps have roughly a five percent chance of being related to cancer (malignant), while fibroids have less than a one percent likelihood of malignancy.[4][10]"
Endometriosis,https://ada.com/conditions/endometriosis/,,"Symptoms occur during the menstrual period, when the patches of abnormal tissue begin to bleed. The typical symptoms are very painful periods and heavy or irregular menstrual bleeding. People with endometriosis also have pain in the abdomen or lower back, pain when urinating or opening the bowels, pain during sexual intercourse, bloating, nausea and vomiting.",[],"The diagnosis is usually made by an experienced doctor or gynecologist based on the symptoms and gynecological examination. Often a scan of the reproductive organs (the ovaries and the womb) is done to look for other causes. The best test for confirming the diagnosis is a surgical procedure called laparoscopy (keyhole surgery), during which patches of the womb lining can be seen on the abdominal organs.","There is no cure for endometriosis, so treatment involves controlling the symptoms. Simple pain medication, such as paracetamol, may help with period pain. Other treatments include hormone medications, which help to stabilize hormone levels and reduce the amount of menstrual bleeding, or medications that stop menstruation from occurring. These treatments reduce the symptoms and slow the growth of the abnormal tissue. If these are not helpful, surgical removal of the tissue may be helpful for some people.",[],[]
Enlarged Prostate,https://ada.com/conditions/enlarged-prostate/,,"Because the prostate is positioned so close to the bladder, penis and rectum, most disorders which cause enlargement of the prostate share several basic symptoms. These include:[1][3][4][5][6]Urgency, an urgent, at times uncontrollable, need to urinate, which may lead to incontinence if the person can’t make it to the bathroom in time
Trouble urinating
Frequent urination
Urinary hesitancy, i.e. slow start till urine streams out
Decreased stream of urine (weak flow)
Frequent need to urinate at night (nocturia)
Intermittent flow, i.e. stopping and starting
Leaking or dribbling urineIn severe cases of an enlarged prostate, whatever the cause, urinary retention (being unable to completely empty the bladder) may also occur.In addition, prostatitis may also have some or all of the following symptoms:[7]Blood in urine (hematuria) or in semen
Pain in the penis and testicles
Burning or painful sensation during urination
Painful or difficult ejaculation
Urethral discharge
Pain and/or pressure in the rectum
Painful defecation (painful bowel movements)
Discomfort and/or pain in the genitals, groin, lower back and/or lower abdomen
Recurring urinary tract infections (UTIs)
Sexual problems and loss of sex drive
Postcoital pain (pain after having sex)In the case of prostate cancer, there may be no immediate symptoms, or there may be urinary symptoms like those listed above. In addition, there may be symptoms such as:Hematuria (blood in the urine) or blood in semen
New onset of erectile dysfunction
Back, especially lower back, hip or pelvic pain
Unexplained weight lossIt should be noted that a lot of the urinary symptoms above could also be caused by diabetes or may be related to the use of certain medications. If any of these symptoms are detected, it is of paramount importance that a physician is consulted and the cause diagnosed, so that appropriate next steps can be taken.","A variety of different conditions and biological processes can cause the prostate to become enlarged. These include:ProstatitisProstatitis is the painful inflammation of the prostate and can affect men of any age. There are several types of prostatitis:[8]Chronic bacterial prostatitis
Acute bacterial prostatitis
Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome
Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitisChronic bacterial prostatitis, the most common type of prostatitis, can affect all adult men and sometimes accompanies recurring urinary tract infections.[9] It can occur when bacteria from the bowel transfer to the skin, to the urethra and then up into the urinary tract. Another cause is urinary retention, caused by an enlarged prostate, bladder or kidney stones, causing a urinary tract infection that then spreads to the prostate.Factors that put individuals at risk of prostatitis, other than UTIs, include prostate surgery or any complications of prostate surgery, catheterisation (using a thin, flexible tube called a catheter to drain urine from the bladder, e.g. when healing after surgery), and infections spreading from other parts of the body. For prostatitis to be considered chronic, symptoms have to recur for at least three months. Recurrence is possible because the prostate can harbor infection. Symptoms can come and go. Chronic prostatitis tends not to cause fevers.Acute prostatitis is caused by infection and manifests with chills, fever and muscle pain, in addition to the multitude of urinary symptoms mentioned above ,often along with cloudy-appearing urine. It often causes intense/severe abdominal and/or pelvic pain. It is relatively rare compared to chronic prostatitis, but must be treated promptly. Complications can include developing a prostate abscess and also urinary retention, where the patient is unable to pass urine due to pain, and which requires catheterisation. A prostate abscess requires surgical intervention.[8]Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome can cause persistent discomfort and/or pain in the lower pelvic region, mainly around the anus and the base of the penis. The causes of CPPS are not well understood and may involve autoimmune responses, nerve problems, inflammation, or another, yet unidentified cause.In asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis, there are no symptoms. The condition is usually diagnosed in the course of a prostate examination for other conditions or as part of a urologic routine check-up. It can cause elevated PSA-values - this is an enzyme produced by the prostate, often looked at during routine urologic check-ups of men over 50 and which can be detected in the blood.Prostatitis is not a sexually-transmitted infection, although it can be caused by one. Prostatitis itself cannot be passed on via sexual activity, but sexually-transmitted infections that cause prostatitis can be. Prostatitis is not prostate cancer, and there is currently no evidence to suggest that getting prostatitis increases the risk of prostate cancer.[8]Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a common problem affecting men over the age of forty. By the time men turn 50 or older, an average of 40% have BPH to some degree. In BPH, the transition zone of the prostate enlarges, constricting the urethra, hindering, in some cases, the bladder’s ability to empty by throttling the flow of urine, which would normally move through the urethra and out of the bladder.Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia is not cancer, but it can affect a person’s quality of life due to the urinary problems it causes, especially the increased need to urinate at night, which disrupts sleep. If left untreated, BPH can cause complications such as kidney damage, urinary retention (the bladder not fully emptying anymore), bladder or kidney stones and UTIs, all due to disrupted urination. As it is largely an age-related disorder, BPH can worsen as it progresses, if left unaddressed.For more information, see this resource on BPHProstate cancerThis is the second most common kind of cancer affecting men, after skin cancer. Men who are at particular risk are:Men older than fifty years of age
Men with a family history of prostate cancer
Men affected by obesity and/or who consume a diet high in animal fat
Men of African descent,e.g. African-American menProstate cancer can remain in the prostate and spread to closely located surrounding areas/tissues of the body - this is known as locally advanced prostate cancer; or it may spread to other parts of the body - this is known as advanced prostate cancer or metastatic prostate cancer.Prostate cancer has a good survival rate. This is because it progresses slowly and may be found and treated before it has a chance to spread too far and become life-limiting.","In order to establish the possible underlying causes for an enlarged prostate, doctors will perform a variety of tests:Tests which are commonly used to find the cause of an enlarged prostate include:A digital rectal exam: A physician or nurse will insert a gloved finger into the patient’s rectum to digitally examine the prostate for swelling and/or enlargement.
Swab tests for urethral discharge or urine: To determine underlying conditions such as STIs/STDs (sexually transmitted infections/diseases) and urinary tract infections. A swab of discharge or urine is taken and sent to a medical laboratory for culturing, so that any microorganisms are identified.
Urinalysis: A urine sample is sent to a medical laboratory for analysis and may be tested for urea nitrogen or creatinine, among other things.
Blood tests: A sample of blood is sent to a medical laboratory for analysis, which may include tests for creatinine or blood urea nitrogen, as well as antibodies and infectious agents.
Prostate-specific antigen test: A blood sample is sent to a medical laboratory to be tested for prostate-specific antigen, an enzyme produced by cells in the prostate. A change in PSA levels can indicate that there is a problem with the prostate.If patients are referred to a urologist, they may have further tests, including:Ultrasounds to check the kidneys, the amount of urine left in bladder and the prostate itself.
Urine flow studies, which involve urinating into a specialised device that measures the speed/rate of urine flow. A flow that is slower than normal may indicate an enlarged prostate.
A cystoscopy, in which a tiny camera is threaded up the urethra at the end of the very thin, flexible tube. This can pick up damage, inflammation or changes in the bladder and is usually done if there are symptoms such as blood in the urine, painful urination, or a UTI.
Bladder pressure (urodynamic) tests, in which tube sensors are placed in the bladder and sometimes also the rectum to measure pressure in the urethra, bladder and possibly rectum. An enlarged prostate can cause pressure in any of those places to increase, because it presses on the bladder and rectum.
The International Prostate Symptom Score, a questionnaire formulated to determine the severity and duration of prostate symptoms.Before referring the patient for tests, the physician may also ask questions about the following in order to determine the possible causes of the discomfort, their severity, and their duration:Medications used, prescribed and over the counter-medication
Other medical conditions, such as diabetes
Medical conditions in other family members
Lifestyle and diet
Existing symptoms: their duration, whether they are getting worse and how they are affecting quality of life.","Treatment for an enlarged prostate will depend on the condition which has caused the prostate to enlarge. No one treatment is best for every patient, and there are a number of treatment options available. Some may be as minor as lifestyle changes, and others may involve a hospital stay and surgery.Treatment for prostatitisTreatment for prostatitis includes:Antibiotics to kill the infectious agent
Alpha-blockers, which relax the muscles near the prostate and relieve pressure on the urethra
Other medications, such as finasteride or quercetin
Muscle relaxants
Painkillers to manage general discomfort/pain
Laxatives to manage bowel discomfort caused by constipationIn rare cases, prostatectomy (prostate surgery) may be necessary. See this resource on prostatectomy for more information.Treatment for BPHTreatment for Benign Prostate Hyperplasia can involve:[10][11]Lifestyle changes, such as limiting a night-time consumption of liquids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, avoiding medication such as diuretics, decongestants and antihistamines and getting more exercise, as well as dietary improvements, such as eating more fibre, avoiding artificial sweeteners and sweetened beverages.
Medication, such as alpha-blockers or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.
Interventions, such as the Urolift® system, a non-surgical proprietary device that uses tiny implants to lift the prostate away from the urethra and thereby relieve BPH symptoms that result from pressure on the urethra.[12]
Surgical procedures, such as a prostatectomy (removal of the prostate), transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) (using heat/microwaves),[13][14] prostate laser, and Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP).
Herbal prostate treatments, such as saw palmetto extract. Saw palmetto extract is made from the fruit of the saw palmetto, which is native to the southeast and Gulf coasts of North America and may potentially assist in reducing urinary frequency and increasing urinary flow.For more information, see this resource on BPH.Treatment for prostate cancerTreatment of prostate cancer can involve:[15][16][17][18]Prostatectomy: The surgical removal of all or part of the prostate gland, which can be done as open surgery or laparoscopically (keyhole surgery). There are several different types of prostatectomy.
External beam radiotherapy: This involves x-ray beams, which are focused on the prostate to destroy cancer cells. This is a non-surgical option.
Permanent seed brachytherapy: This involves implanting small radioactive pellets into the prostate gland to destroy cancer cells.
Hormone therapy: This may be used instead of radiation therapy or if the cancer has spread too far to be susceptible to prostatectomy or radiation treatment; it involves orchiectomy (surgical castration) and/or various treatments to lower androgen levels (chemical castration).[19]
Cryotherapy: This is an option for cases where the cancer is still within the prostate or is locally advanced. It is non-invasive and involves the insertion of cryotherapy needles into the prostate, through which a certain gas is then passed in order to freeze the tissue and thereby also ideally killing the cancer cells.[20]
Focused ultrasound therapy: This is a non-invasive method of treating prostate cancer using focused beams of ultrasound energy to heat and destroy cancer locations in the prostate.[21]See this resource on prostatectomy procedures for more information about surgical treatments for prostate cancer.",[],"Q: Can an enlarged prostate affect my sexual function?
A: Whether or not an enlarged prostate affects sexual function depends on the underlying cause.Prostatitis can cause erectile dysfunction because of pain.[22] It can also result in painful ejaculation, which can lead to problems with sexual pleasure and indirectly cause problems with sexual function.[23] This is likely to be temporary, and matters will improve along with the condition.BPH itself does not cause erectile dysfunction, but some treatments for it, for example the drug finasteride, can. However, there are other drugs available, such as terazosin, tamsulosin and doxazosin, that are less likely to cause this side effect. Likewise, Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) can cause erectile dysfunction in some men.Prostate Cancer can cause problems such as erectile dysfunction, and if there is a sudden onset of such problems where no problems have existed before, a physician should be consulted. Some treatments for prostate cancer can affect sexual performance, e.g. by causing erectile dysfunction, due to the side-effects of hormone therapy, damage to erectile tissue resulting from radiation or brachytherapy or severed nerves and muscles after prostate surgery.Q: Can an enlarged prostate affect my fertility?
A: Prostate problems, such as those resulting from pain and prostate cancer treatments, can lead to problems with getting and maintaining an erection and with ejaculation, which then affects successful conception. However, any very enlarged prostate may also cause problems with sperm transport. If the prostate is enlarged, it can press on the ejaculatory ducts and prevent the adequate formulation of semen.[24]Treatments for prostate cancer, especially radiation treatment and hormone treatment, can affect male fertility, owing to their effects on sperm production. Prostatectomy, when it involves the removal of the entire prostate and seminal vesicles, can render men unable to ejaculate. Radiation treatment causes a decline in sperm production and/or sperm quality, and the same is true of many chemotherapy treatments.Inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis) can affect sperm motility, i.e.the way sperms move around, and fertility problems might result. Inflammation of the prostate can also cause bladder problems that lead to retrograde ejaculation, which is when semen enters the bladder rather than leaving the body.[25]"
Erectile Dysfunction,https://ada.com/conditions/erectile-dysfunction/,,[],[],[],[],[],[]
Esophageal Cancer,https://ada.com/conditions/esophageal-cancer/,,"Symptoms of esophageal cancer include difficulty swallowing (some people feel food sticking in their chest), regurgitating undigested food, reflux, heartburn, hoarseness or coughing when eating or drinking. Later symptoms may include weight loss, chest pain and vomiting blood. Esophageal cancer is often symptomless in the early stages of the disease, and has been known to cause mild symptoms which may be mistaken for other illnesses.",[],"A diagnosis is made based upon the symptoms, a physical examination and a test called endoscopy (in which a small flexible camera is inserted into the body through the mouth to look at the esophagus and stomach). If anything abnormal is seen, a sample of the esophagus can be taken (a biopsy) to investigate for cancer. Scans, such as a CT (computed tomography) are often needed to determine the size, location and developmental stage of the esophageal cancer.","Treatment of esophageal cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. These combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, esophageal cancer can be treated by radiotherapy, surgical removal of some or all of the esophagus, and chemotherapy or a combination of therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment. Counseling or involvement in a support group may be helpful to the patient in coming to terms with their diagnosis.","Gastroesophageal reflux should be treated effectively and monitored for signs of developing esophageal cancer.

Essential Hypertension,https://ada.com/conditions/essential-hypertension/,,"In most cases, there will be no apparent symptoms of essential hypertension, and it will only be discovered during a regular medical examination. If essential hypertension is not diagnosed, the condition has the potential to worsen and create heart or kidney problems. Sometimes, people with essential hypertension may experience headaches, dizziness and blurred vision, but these symptoms are unlikely to occur until blood pressure reaches very high levels. Some people report that their heartbeat seems louder than usual and feels as if it is inside the ear; this may be more prominent the higher the blood pressure is.[4] People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to hypertension can use the free Ada app for a symptom assessment.If a person experiences vomiting or nausea, severe headaches, vision changes or nosebleeds, it may be a sign of malignant hypertension – a much more dangerous type of high blood pressure.[5] If these symptoms appear, urgent medical attention should be sought.","Essential hypertension is defined by its lack of identifiable causes. However, certain risk factors that make the condition more likely have been identified. These include:[6]ObesityObesity puts extra strain on the heart, increasing the risk of high blood pressure.GeneticsThose with a family history of essential hypertension are more likely to be at risk of developing the condition themselves. 50 genes have been identified as linked to high blood pressure.AgingMultiple factors related to aging have been shown to increase the likelihood of essential hypertension. These include the stiffening of the arteries and the onset of certain renal microvascular diseases not yet perceived as a cause.[7]StressIt is thought that long-term or chronic mental stress is linked to the development of essential hypertension.[8]SaltExcessive salt (sodium) consumption, defined by the American Heart Association as eating over 2300 mg per day, can play a role in the onset of essential hypertension. Salt increases retention of water in the body, which in turn increases the volume of blood and, consequently, blood pressure.ReninThe enzyme renin, produced by the kidneys, is part of the body’s “renin angiotensin system”, which is responsible for controlling arterial blood pressure and is closely linked to both essential hypertension and hypertension in general. People with both low and high levels of renin are at risk of the condition.Lack of exerciseThe link between leading a sedentary lifestyle and an increased chance of essential hypersensitivity is well studied. To lead a healthy lifestyle and reduce the risk of high blood pressure, it is recommended that adults engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity five days a week.[9][10]RaceResearch indicates that hypertension is often more common in people of Afro-Caribbean descent. Hypertension also tends to occur earlier in life, be more severe and be associated with a higher risk of organ damage in people from this group.Alcohol consumptionExcessive alcohol intake, defined by the U.S. Department of Health as consuming more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, is associated with hypertension.Physical inactivityA lack of physical activity is associated with hypertension. Exercise is one of the key methods of managing high blood pressure.","Essential hypertension is diagnosed by taking blood pressure measurements using a blood pressure monitor, which is also called a sphygmomanometer or an aneroid device.[11] These tests are routinely carried out as part of a normal medical examination. Stress, anger, physical exercise and other factors can temporarily raise a person’s blood pressure, meaning a diagnosis of essential hypertension can only be made when results are consistently high. Multiple readings, including readings taken outside of the hospital or doctor’s office, should be taken. To do this, a doctor may ask people to measure their own blood pressure daily, at home or at a pharmacy.Blood pressure readings are expressed as two numbers, for example: 120/80. The first number is systolic pressure, which shows the amount of force being exerted on the artery walls as the heart pumps. The second number is diastolic pressure, which shows the amount of force being exerted on the artery walls between beats of the heart.A healthy systolic reading is 120 or lower.[12] Between 120 and 139 is considered normal, but not optimum, and over 140 is hypertensive. A healthy diastolic reading is 80 or lower. Between 80 and 89 is considered normal, but not optimum, and over 90 is hypertensive. These values can be used as a general guide, but it should be noted that the thresholds for healthy and hypertensive blood pressure tend to differ between countries.People worried about their risk of hypertension should visit a doctor for testing. The free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment.","Hypertension can be managed through a combination of lifestyle changes and medication.Doctors may recommend a range of lifestyle adjustments that will commonly include:[13]Adopting a healthy, nutritious diet, ideally vegetarian or vegan in nature
Exercising
Stress relief techniques
Reducing alcohol and tobacco use
Consuming less salt, cheese, bread and processed foodsIf lifestyle changes do not produce satisfactory results, a doctor may prescribe medication aimed at lowering blood pressure. These may include:Beta blockers
Calcium channel blockers
Diuretics
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
Angiotensin II receptor blockers
Renin inhibitors",[],"Q: Can essential hypertension be treated successfully?
A: Yes, in many cases, there is a good chance that blood pressure can be lowered if the appropriate treatment methods are followed. To ensure blood pressure remains at a healthy level, most people will be required to maintain lifestyle changes and, if required, take medication, possibly for the rest of their lives.Q: What is malignant essential hypertension?
A: Malignant essential hypertension, sometimes called accelerated hypertension, is a form of hypertensive emergency. It involves high blood pressure that develops very quickly, causing serious complications. The malignant variety is extremely rare, affecting roughly one percent of those with high blood pressure, but if it is suspected, it should be treated as a medical emergency.[17]Q: What is benign essential hypertension?
A:When essential hypertension remains in its early stages for a prolonged period of time and without a specific known cause, it is known as benign essential hypertension. In this state, the condition will generally be symptomless and develop very slowly. It is still important to seek treatment after a diagnosis of benign essential hypertension.[18]What is non-essential hypertension?
A: Non-essential hypertension is an alternative name for secondary hypertension. Essential hypertension is characterized by a lack of clearly attributable causes, whereas secondary hypertension is directly linked to a variety of vascular, endocrine, heart and kidney conditions.Q: Can pregnancy cause essential hypertension?
A: Essential hypertension is defined by its lack of a clearly attributable cause, meaning that pregnancy cannot be said to cause the condition. However, pregnancy can cause a form of hypertension known as gestational hypertension. By definition, this form of hypertension must occur after 20 weeks of pregnancy in a previously not hypertensive person and disappear after the delivery of the baby Longer lasting hypertension, detected either before pregnancy or before the 20th week of pregnancy, and which remains after delivery of the baby, is defined as chronic hypertension and can be a kind of essential hypertension. Both gestational and chronic hypertension can lead to preeclampsia, a potentially serious but treatable complication of pregnancy.[19] For more information, take a look at this resource on preeclampsia.Q: What is hypertensive heart disease?
A: Hypertensive heart disease is an umbrella term for various heart conditions that are caused by chronically or prolonged high blood pressure levels. High blood pressure puts extra strain on the heart and the vessels surrounding and supplying the heart, something which can lead to the development of a variety of heart disorders. These include heart failure, coronary artery disease and the thickening of the heart muscle, among others. People at risk of hypertensive heart disease should talk to their doctor about methods of preventing potential complications, e.g. attending regular check-ups and taking medication regularly as required by their prescription. This will typically also include getting plenty of exercise, eating a balanced, nutritious diet and losing weight, if the person in question is considerably overweight or obese."
Essential Tremor,https://ada.com/conditions/essential-tremor/,,"The main symptom of an essential tremor is an involuntary, quick, fine shaking of the hands and, less commonly, the legs. This may affect the ability to hold objects and write. Some people have a tremor affecting the head, which causes quick head nodding or bobbing. The symptoms may be made worse by stress and caffeine.",[],"The diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms, the appearance of the tremor and examination of the neurological system. Sometimes a blood test to check liver function or a MRI scan of the head might be needed to exclude other causes of tremor.","Treatment is often not needed if the tremor is mild and does not cause any difficulty completing tasks. Some medications usually used to treat high blood pressure or seizures can help with tremor when used at low doses. If medication is not helpful, very severe cases can be treated with brain surgery. This is uncommon.",[],[]
Fabry Disease,https://ada.com/conditions/fabry-disease/,,"Signs of the condition typically manifest in early childhood and develop as the person ages. The symptoms
of Fabry disease are varied and some are potentially life threatening.The following symptoms are most commonly observed in childhood and adolescence, though they may be
experienced in adulthood too:[3]Pain and burning sensations, particularly in the hands and feet
Dark red spots on the skin, typically between the belly button and knees (sometimes referred to as angiokeratoma)
Clouded vision
Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and general hearing problems
Stomach, back, or kidney pain
Gastrointestinal problems including diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea.The following, more serious, symptoms of Fabry’s disease are more likely to appear in adulthood:Osteoporosis
Heart attack or heart failure
Enlarged heart
Stroke
Kidney failure or serious renal complications","Fabry disease is caused by a genetic mutation. It is an X-linked disorder, meaning that the condition only
affects the X-chromosome. As females have two X-chromosomes and males just one, males stand a far higher
chance of inheriting the condition from a parent, because a second  X-chromosome offers some – but not
total – protection against the mutation.[4] The children of females with Fabry disease, both male and
female, stand a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disorder. Female children of males with Fabry disease
will always inherit the disorder, though they may not always display symptoms. Male children of males with
the condition will not inherit Fabry disease.The genetic defect leads to a lack of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A that in turn leads to a buildup of
globotriaosylceramide, a type of fat that is normally broken down as part of healthy cell function. The
severity of the disorder depends on how much alpha-galactosidase the body produces. In some, this can be
none at all, while in others the enzyme is present but in insufficient quantities.[5]","The early diagnosis of Fabry disease is important for beginning the management of the condition. This
process may begin when a person displays some of the common symptoms and a doctor suspects the presence
of the disorder. However, due to the rarity of Fabry disease, the initial signs of the disorder may not
be recognized and the disorder left undiagnosed. If an individual or family member has observed similar
symptoms in other family members and there is a suspicion of the condition, a doctor’s opinion should be
sought.[6]Laboratory testing can confirm the presence of Fabry disease. Enzyme assay, as the method is known,
measures the volume of alpha-galactosidase A in the body. For males, this involves a blood test. If
the blood shows a person has low levels of the enzyme, Fabry disease can be confirmed. This test can
also be carried out on females, but may not be as accurate. DNA testing is a far more accurate test
for Fabry disease diagnosis in females.Prenatal (before birth) testing for Fabry disease is also available, though this test will usually
only be offered to parents with Fabry disease or those with a strong family history of the disorder.","There is no cure for Fabry disease so treatment is centered on managing the symptoms of the disorder.
This can be combined with enzyme replacement therapy, which has demonstrated some success in combating
the enzyme deficiency and should be started as soon as a diagnosis is made.[7]Enzyme replacement therapyEnzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is aimed at reversing the abnormalities in the cells of those with
Fabry disease, thereby easing the symptoms of the condition.[8] Only in use since 2001, ERT is a
relatively new treatment method for people with Fabry disease. Two medications are available for
this treatment, Replagal and Fabrazyme, both of which are given through a drip into the veins. ERT
has been shown to improve symptoms, as well as reducing the risk of kidney problems, stroke, and
hearing loss.[8]Although enzyme-replacement therapy aims to treat the cause of Fabry disease, additional treatments
might be needed to reduce symptoms and prevent complications.PainTo combat pain, doctors will generally prescribe pain relief medication such as gabapentin,
carbamazepine, phenytoin and opioids. The latter are generally reserved for particularly severe pain.Skin rashThe skin rash associated with Fabry disease does not generally cause discomfort but can in some cases
bleed. Cosmetic treatments such as laser therapy may be used to remove or lessen the rash.Hearing lossIndividuals experiencing hearing loss can be fitted with a hearing aid.Gastrointestinal problemsGastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and nausea are often managed with medications.
Doctors may also advise people experiencing gastrointestinal problems to avoid any foods that trigger
symptoms and to maintain a low-fat diet.",[],"Q: What is the life expectancy of people with Fabry disease?
A: Males with the Fabry disease have a life expectancy of roughly 60 years, while women have a life expectancy of roughly 75 years. Life expectancy, however, strongly depends on the severity of the condition and the age at which it is diagnosed.Q: Can Fabry disease be detected by looking at the eyes?
A: Opticians and other eyecare professionals may be able to detect the presence of a cloudy buildup on the front of the eye, which can often be an early symptom of the condition. However, full confirmation of the diagnosis of Fabry disease is only possible with further testing.[10]Q: What are the symptoms of Fabry disease in females?
A: Females with Fabry disease can develop the same symptoms of Fabry disease as men, including pain and burning sensations, rashes and gastrointestinal problems. In general, however, females develop these symptoms later and to a less severe extent than males.[11]"
Failure to Thrive,https://ada.com/conditions/failure-to-thrive/,,"The symptoms experienced as a result of failure to thrive depend on the severity and the underlying cause or causes of the condition. However, the key symptom of the condition is a child not developing and growing normally as compared to children of the same age and sex.Symptoms of failure to thrive include:[2][3]Height, weight and head circumference which do not match with standard growth charts
Weight which consistently falls below the third to fifth percentile
Growth which has stopped or slowed significantly
Physical skills which do not develop as expected (such as standing and walking)
Mental and social skills which do not develop as expected
Constipation
Excessive crying
Excessive sleepiness
IrritabilityChildren may not experience all the possible symptoms of failure to thrive.","The basic cause of failure to thrive is a child not receiving, or being unable to retain and absorb, the necessary amount of calories and nutrients needed to support healthy growth. The reasons behind this failure are numerous, and more than one factor may play a role simultaneously. There are, however, two broad reasons why failure to thrive occurs: medical disorders and social/environmental factors.Medical disordersMedical disorders that may contribute to a failure to thrive include:[1][2]Problems chewing or swallowing (caused by a cleft palate, for example)
Genetic problems (such as Down syndrome)
Hormone problems
Brain or nervous system damage
Heart or lung problems
Blood disorders (such as anemia)
Gastrointestinal problems
Chronic infections (such as HIV)
Metabolic disorders (such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis)Social and environmental factorsSocial and environmental factors as to why a child does not receive sufficient nutrition can include poverty, parental neglect or abuse and parental mental health issues. Parents may also feed their child food lacking in sufficient nutrients or not be aware of how to properly prepare food and formula. Social and environmental factors are the most common cause of failure to thrive.[1]","Diagnosis is usually made by a child health nurse or pediatrician following routine check-ups, during which weight, height and head circumference measurements are taken. The parents may also be asked about feeding routines and any issues that may be affecting the child’s access to proper nutrition, as well as about the family’s medical history. If there are signs that a child is failing to thrive, further tests may be undertaken to investigate and diagnose the underlying causes.","The treatment of failure to thrive depends on the underlying cause. If the condition is the result of an underlying medical disorder, treatment will be aimed at remedying or managing this condition.If social and environmental factors are the cause, parental counselling and support may be recommended. The aim of this is to educate the parents about proper nutrition and to help find solutions to any financial and/or emotional issues that may be present. A meal plan may also be devised for the child to ensure that they receive the calories and nutrition needed.In cases of severe failure to thrive, a child may be admitted to hospital where a team of doctors, pediatricians, nutritionists and social workers (among other professionals) will work together to formulate an appropriate treatment plan.",Regular check ups with a child health nurse can help to diagnose failure to thrive early on. Parenting classes or support groups are also a good way to develop ways and habits of improving a child’s nutrition.,[]
Familial Hypercholesterolemia,https://ada.com/conditions/familial-hypercholesterolemia/,,"In many cases, especially in younger people, there will be no obvious symptoms of familial hypercholesterolemia. However, if signs or symptoms do present themselves, they may include:[4]Xanthomas: Fatty deposits on the skin that typically appear on the hands, knees, buttocks, elbows and ankles.
Xanthelasmas: Deposits of cholesterol around the eyelids.
Arcus senilis: A white-colored ring around the cornea
Arthralgia (joint pain)
Tendonitis (inflamed tendons)
History of unusual skin lesions
At least one parent with severe hypercholesterolemiaThe most significant consequence of familial hypercholesterolemia, however, is heart disease. In cases of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, signs of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, such as angina and heart attack, will appear in middle age if the condition is not treated. In cases of homozygous hypercholesterolemia, symptoms occur in childhood, and many people with this condition die before the age of 20. Heart disease can lead to potentially life-threatening complications such as heart attack.","Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder caused by a mutated gene. This mutation disrupts the body’s ability to remove low-density lipoprotein from the blood as it normally would, resulting in the development of high levels of cholesterol.The condition is autosomal dominant, meaning the gene mutation can be inherited if only one parent is a carrier. In these instances, the condition is known as heterozygous FH. In the rare case where both parents are carriers, a particularly severe variety of familial hypercholesterolemia known as homozygous FH will be passed on.The condition is differentiated from standard hypercholesterolemia by its hereditary nature. Anyone can develop hypercholesterolemia – which is generally caused by unhealthy lifestyle choices – whereas only those with a family history of the condition can develop familial hypercholesterolemia. Standard high cholesterol generally develops in older individuals, whereas the genetic variety is present from birth and has a tendency to be more aggressive.[3]","Diagnosing familial hypercholesterolemia will generally involve three stages: an examination of an individual’s medical history, a physical examination and blood tests.Medical historyAs familial hypercholesterolemia is hereditary, doctors will first inquire about a person’s family medical history. This will particularly focus on the parents, who are the carriers of the disorder. In some cases, the genetic form of the condition may have been misdiagnosed as standard hypercholesterolemia or may not have been diagnosed at all, meaning that it is possible to be unknowingly at risk of developing the genetic form of the condition.Physical examinationDoctors will also carry out a full physical examination to help diagnose familial hypercholesterolemia. This will particularly focus on checking for fatty deposits on the skin of hands, ankles, knees, elbows et al. and around the eyes – one of the more common exterior symptoms of high cholesterol levels. The doctor will also conduct a thorough cardiovascular examination.Blood testsBlood tests will be ordered to confirm a diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia. Blood tests will check for an individual’s total cholesterol level (HDL and LDL cholesterol) as well as the specific amount of LDL cholesterol.Adults with the condition will normally have total cholesterol levels of around 300 milligrams per deciliter and over, whereas children will have levels of around 250 milligrams per deciliter and over. LDL cholesterol levels will typically be around 220 milligrams per deciliter and over in adults and around 170-200 milligrams per deciliter and over in children.[5]However, the exact levels involved will differ according to whether the condition is heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In heterozygous FH, LDLc levels are usually higher than 250mg/dL, around 290mg/dL to 300mg/dL, and increase with age. In people younger than 20 years of age, an LDLc level higher than 200mg/dL suggests heterozygous FH.In homozygous FH, however, total cholesterol and LDLc levels higher than 600mg/dL are typical in both adults and children.Genetic tests can also be used to determine the presence of the defective gene, and a test for fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) can allow doctors to see how the body is absorbing cholesterol.Read more about Blood Test Results »","Treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia aims to  reduce the risk of heart disease or heart attack. It usually combines the use of:Medication:Statins (medicines which help lower the level of LDL in the blood) are typically prescribed to treat familial hypercholesterolemia. They are generally effective, but may be necessary throughout an individual’s life. Another medication, ezetimibe, may also be prescribed alongside statins if statins alone are ineffective.[6] For patients with FH, particularly homozygous FH, treatment should ideally be managed by a lipid specialist.  I
Diet and lifestyle changes: Combating high cholesterol levels may also involve making healthy lifestyle choices, such as avoiding tobacco products, excessive amounts of alcohol and remaining physically active. Diet changes may also be necessary. This will focus on avoiding saturated fats present in foods, such as dairy products, meat and pastry.[7] A vegetarian or even vegan lifestyle may be the best option for people with FH.",[],"Q: What is the life expectancy for those with familial hypercholesterolemia?
A: Without treatment, the life expectancy of those with familial hypercholesterolemia can be reduced by approximately 15-30 years. However, in people with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the life expectancy may only be 20 years or less. Treatment, however, can manage the condition and lead to a significantly improved prognosis.[9]Q: Can familial hypercholesterolemia be treated without the use of statins?
A: Statins are normally the preferred medication for treating high cholesterol. However, if side effects occur, or statins are not an available option for various reasons, there are other medications which can be used instead. These include cholesterol absorption inhibitors, sequestrants and niacin or vitamin B-3. The choice of treatment route should always be decided based on the recommendations of a medical professional.[10]"
Febrile Seizure,https://ada.com/conditions/febrile-seizure/,,"The main symptom is a fit or convulsions which last less than 5 minutes while the child has a temperature of 38℃ or higher. The child may lose consciousness and roll their eyes back, while the arms and legs stiffen and twitch (convulse). There may be other symptoms, such as irregular breathing or vomiting. After the seizure, the child may be sleepy, even if they were completely awake before the seizure.",[],"A doctor can usually diagnose a febrile seizure after hearing a description of the seizure and about the recent health of the child. If the cause of the fever is unknown, or if the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, tests might be required to exclude conditions which could cause fever and seizures.","Febrile seizures usually pass quickly. It is important that the child is safe during the seizure, so may help to place them on a large bed, or on the floor, away from objects that they may hit. Turn them onto their side in the recovery position. There is no need to hold the child down during the seizure, and nothing should be put in their mouth. The duration of seizures should be measured and it lasts longer than 5 minutes with no signs of stopping, an ambulance should be called, or the child should be taken to hospital for review.",Treating fevers with paracetamol or ibuprofen may help to prevent some episodes of febrile seizure.,[]
Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,https://ada.com/conditions/fetal-alcohol-spectrum-disorders/,,"The symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome can be different from person to person, depending on how much alcohol the mother drank and the stage in the pregnancy that this occurred. Typical signs of fetal alcohol syndrome in a newborn baby include being small at birth and certain facial characteristics, such as wide-set eyes, flattening of the groove between the nose and mouth, and a thin upper lip. As the child gets older, other problems may become obvious, such as learning difficulties, attention difficulties (many children have attention deficit disorder), hearing or vision problems, and behavioral problems, such as impulsiveness and hyperactivity.",[],"The diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome is often complicated because the signs and symptoms can be difficult to recognize. The diagnosis is made by an experienced pediatrician based on the appearance and symptoms of a child whose mother drank alcohol while pregnant. The main features needed to diagnose this condition are: growth problems, the characteristic facial features (a thin upper lip, smoothed groove between nose and mouth, wide-set eyes) and signs or symptoms of developmental brain problems (learning difficulties, low IQ) in a mother who drank alcohol while pregnant.","There is no cure for fetal alcohol syndrome disorders. Treatment requires managing the symptoms, and providing support for the complications, including extra support at school, and early recognition and management of attention and behavior issues. Family counseling may also be helpful.",The most important measure to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome is not drinking alcohol when pregnant.,[]
Fibrocystic Breasts,https://ada.com/conditions/fibrocystic-breasts/,,"The symptoms of fibrocystic breasts can differ between people. Usually, they are most intense about one week before menstruation and decrease in intensity shortly after the menstruation has started. Breast symptoms are usually symmetrical.Some women who are affected by fibrocystic breasts may not notice any symptoms at all. However, women with this condition may experience:[4][5]Painful or tender breasts before menstruation
Nipple discharge
Lumps or nodules in the breasts
Change in breast size
Changes to menstrual cycle, if not yet past menopauseIf you are experiencing symptoms of fibrocystic breasts, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.","Fibrocystic changes refer to two conditions:Fibrous tissue
Non-cancerous cysts.Cysts develop when fluid builds up inside the breast glands and is encapsulated. These begin with microcysts, which are too small to feel and only visible under a microscope. If fluid continues to build up, larger macrocysts may form, which can be felt easily and may be up to one or two inches in diameter.[1]Fibrosis refers to the thickening and scarring of tissue, leading to areas that feel rubbery, firm or hard to the touch.Fibrocystic changes occur in women of childbearing age, usually subsiding with menopause. The tissue alters over the course of the menstrual cycle and also significantly during periods of pregnancy and breastfeeding. These changes are a reaction to the fluctuating levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the body. Changes in hormone levels are also believed to increase the likelihood of developing fibrocystic breasts, often making the condition more noticeable just before the menstrual period.Taking the contraceptive pill may reduce the likelihood of developing fibrocystic breasts. Taking hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) after the menopause can cause women to develop fibrocystic breasts.","Fibrocystic breasts will often be suspected by a doctor on the basis of the symptoms and a physical examination. If there is unusual nipple discharge and/or a mass found during breast examination, ultrasound or mammography scans may then be carried out to confirm diagnosis.The foremost concern is not fibrocystic breast condition itself, which is not normally serious, but the possibility that it may mask breast cancer, which has similar symptoms.In order to rule out a cancer diagnosis, a biopsy may be done, i.e. a test that removes tissue or sometimes fluid from an area. Local anesthetic may be administered, depending on the type of biopsy used.If you are experiencing symptoms of fibrocystic breasts, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.Fibrocystic breasts ultrasoundAn ultrasound scan may be used to produce an image of the internal breast. This will allow doctors to identify different types of cyst which may be present:[1]Simple cyst: This type of cyst appears on the ultrasound scan as a lump which is just filled with fluid. It is deemed to be non-cancerous.
Complex cyst: This type of cyst appears on the ultrasound scan as a lump that is solid, or which has both fluid and solid components. When detected, a biopsy may be done to check whether there are any cancerous cells.Fibrocystic breasts mammogramA mammogram is an X-ray of the breasts. Sometimes a person may have both an ultrasound and a mammogram, as each shows different detail of the breast tissue. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may also be used.Women under the age of 40 do not often have a mammogram, as it is difficult to obtain a clear picture of younger women’s breasts, which are denser, using a mammogram.[5]Fibrocystic breast biopsyA biopsy is a test that removes tissue or sometimes fluid from an area. Cells are then examined under a microscope and further tested to check for the presence of breast cancer.Good to know: About 80% of women who have breast biopsies do not have breast cancer.There are three types of biopsies that may be used:[6][7]Fine needle aspirationIf the lump is easily accessible or is likely to be filled with the fluid, a doctor may perform a fine needle aspiration (FNA), in which fluid is drawn through a needle. The lump should collapse once the fluid inside has been drawn and discarded.If the lump persists, another sample may be taken with a similar method for a biopsy, to examine the cells.Core needle biopsyThis involves using a larger needle through which a small amount of tissue can be removed. Local anesthetic will be used.Surgical biopsyA surgical biopsy is done with local anesthesia. This involves removal of all or part of an abnormal lump.If cancerous or precancerous cells are detected during a biopsy, then further treatment may be required, such as surgery or chemotherapy.","Most people with fibrocystic breasts do not require specific treatment. People with fibrocystic breasts may find that over-the-counter pain relief such as paracetamol may help with the pain and tenderness at times. Many people also find supportive bras and warm compresses helpful for reducing pain. People with distressing or severe symptoms may benefit from the following:[1][4]Hormonal therapy
Draining cysts of fluids
Surgery to remove cysts",[],"Q: Is there a link between fibrocystic breasts and caffeine?
A: Many women report an improvement in symptoms when they eliminate caffeine from their diet, and some studies have suggested a connection. However, there is not yet enough evidence to show whether there is a significant connection beyond the placebo effect.Q: Is it possible to have fibrocystic breasts after menopause?
A: A person is less likely to develop new lumps due to fibrocystic breasts after menopause, though pre-menopausal fibrocystic changes that have persisted may still be discovered at this time. This is due to the decrease in estrogen, which is associated with fibrocystic changes. Some women, who take hormones to treat problems related to menopause, may develop breast lumps. All women, no matter what age, should seek a doctor’s advice for any change or irregularity in their breasts.Q: Fibrocystic breasts and breastfeeding - are there any associated problems?
A: Any fibrocystic breast change should not complicate breastfeeding. Fibrocystic breast change also tends to improve during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is best to seek advice if lumps do appear during breastfeeding, since this can be caused by other medical conditions, such as mastitis, which can lead to complications.Q: Does vitamin E reduce fibrocystic breasts pain?
A: Many women report an improvement in symptoms when they take vitamin E supplements and some studies have shown a connection. However, there is not yet enough evidence to show that vitamin E makes a significant difference to breast pain. Vitamin E deficiency is considered to be rare, as vitamin E is sufficiently present in average nutritional intake."
Fibromyalgia,https://ada.com/conditions/fibromyalgia/,,"The main symptom of fibromyalgia is a deep burning pain or ache which occurs in muscles on both sides of the body and in multiple areas. Other symptoms may include feeling unusually tired, difficulty sleeping, difficulty concentrating and memory problems.",[],"The diagnosis may be made based on the symptoms, the duration of pain and the physical examination. A diary of symptoms may help to make the diagnosis. A blood test may also help to confirm the diagnosis in some people, but a normal or negative result does not exclude fibromyalgia. However, to confirm the diagnosis, a doctor should exclude other possible causes of the symptoms. Blood and urine tests are often done with the aim of excluding other conditions.","Treatment of fibromyalgia can be difficult because the cause is not well understood. Physical therapy and exercise programs are very effective in reducing pain and muscle stiffness for people with fibromyalgia. Some people also find stress-relieving activities helpful. Simple pain relief, such as paracetamol, may provide some relief, as may using hot packs or massage. People who don't get relief through these methods should see a pain specialist, who may be able to recommend other medications.

Folate Deficiency,https://ada.com/conditions/folate-deficiency/,,"Common symptoms of folate deficiency can include:[2][4]Tiredness, fatigue and lethargy
Muscle weakness
Neurological signs, such as a feeling of pins and needles, tingling, or burning (paresthesia)
Psychological problems, such as depression, confusion, memory problems, problems of judgement and understanding
Gastrointestinal signs, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss and diarrhea
Headache and dizziness
Pallor
Shortness of breathHeadache, dizziness, pallor and shortness of breath are also symptoms of anemia. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works. Anemia, particularly megaloblastic anemia, is often the first sign that there is an underlying folate deficiency, and doctors will usually test for folate and Vitamin B12 deficiencies when they encounter anemia.Less common symptoms of folate deficiency are:[2]Fast heartbeat (tachycardia)
Fast breathing (tachypnoea)
Exfoliative dermatitis
Heart murmur
Painful swallowing
A sore tongue (glossitis) and mouth ulcers
Petechiae
Angular stomatitis (fissures in the corners of the mouth)In children with congenital malabsorption disorders, which are rare, neurological problems might also be present.Diagnosis is based on evaluation of symptoms and blood tests. Although there is no official medical consensus of what level of folate in blood serum indicates a deficiency, most practitioners agree that a level of less than seven nanomols per liter (7nmol/L) is problematic. Below that level, the risk of megaloblastic anemia is much higher.[3]  If a blood test reveals anemia, this will lead to further evaluation of the possible causes, including analyzing serum folate levels. Elevated homocysteine levels can also indicate a folate deficiency and can therefore be part of the laboratory testing.The process of diagnosing a folate deficiency involves the exclusion of other possible causes of the symptoms. In cases where anemia is suspected, other possible causes of anemia (eg. iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, chronic disease and others) must be excluded.Physicians will evaluate the patient’s diet for signs of insufficient intake, such as might accompany vegan diets, poor diets, or “fad” diets. Often patients present with a history of alcohol intake which contributes to a poor diet. Other patients may be pregnant or lactating. Certain drugs, such as anticonvulsants, can also cause this type of deficiency.","Folate deficiency has a number of potential causes. Most healthy people absorb sufficient folate from their diets to avoid deficiency, but in some cases the body may increase demand, which, if supplementation doesn’t occur, may lead to deficiency. In other cases, the body may be unable to absorb enough folate, due to low intake or excessive excretion.Causes of folate deficiency include:[1][2][3][5]Low dietary intake due to medically restricted diets such as those followed by people with phenylketonuria or due to fad diets concentrating on foods that do not contain enough folate. Infants who are fed unfortified goat’s milk will also experience folate deficiency, as folate is not naturally present in goat’s milk.
Malabsorption, which can be due to age, liver problems or gastrointestinal problems causing chronic diarrhoea, such as sprue, celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Other causes of malabsorption are pancreatitis, bariatric surgery and extensive surgery involving the large or small intestine. Malabsorption is also a risk for people who use drugs that interfere with the absorption of folate, such as proton-pump inhibitors, some anticonvulsants such as carbramezapine, phenytoin, valproic acid, and phenobarbitol.[6]
Disorders such as leukaemia, carcinomas and lymphomas, which increase the body’s demand for folate and may consequently lead to deficiency if folic acid supplements aren’t taken.
Age, which causes changes in the gastrointestinal systems of people more than 65 years of age. These may lead to reduced absorption and reduced dietary intake.
Alcohol-related damage to the liver, which affects the way in which folate is stored in the liver and increases the amount of folate excreted in urine. People with alcohol dependence may also have a nutritionally insufficient diet.
Pregnancy and lactation, which raise the body’s demand for folate considerably due to the growth of new tissue in both mother and fetus. Sufficient folic acid supplementation is crucial for pregnant women, as a deficiency may cause birth defects. (See below.)
Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke.[7]
Renal dialysis, which affects the amounts of homocysteine in the body and therefore increases the amount of folic acid needed.",[],"In most cases, folate deficiency is relatively easy to correct. In cases where a deficiency has set in due to poor diet or age, taking a folic acid supplement or modifying the diet is sufficient. However, if there is an underlying problem, like alcoholic changes to the liver or a drug interaction or condition causing malabsorption, specialised treatment will be required. The underlying causes of folate deficiency need to be addressed to prevent the problem recurring.Folate deficiency is relatively easily treated in cases where the deficiency is not severe. However, where it has caused anemia, folic acid supplementation and/or correcting diet alone will not be enough. In women with megaloblastic anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency must be ruled out before any folic acid treatment can begin. If complications have occurred, or if there is an underlying condition or factor causing the folate deficiency, the patient may have to be referred to one or more of the following kinds of doctor:[2]Gastroenterologist, a doctor specialising in diseases and disorders of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon and rectum, as well as the pancreas, gallbladder, bile ducts and liver
Dietitian, a certified expert on diet and nutrition
Hematologist, a doctor specialising in diseases and disorders of the bloodNatural sources of folic acidFolate is readily available in many whole foods, such as:[9]Leafy green vegetables (spinach, kale, broccoli, cabbage, and brussels sprouts)
Beetroot
Citrus fruits
Liver. However, liver should be avoided by pregnant women, due to the high levels of Vitamin A it contains. Vitamin A can cause birth defects.
Beans and legumes (peas, pinto, cannellini, garbanzo beans/chickpeas)SupplementationIn some countries, such as the United States, South Africa, Chile, Canada and Costa Rica, grain cereal products (bread, pasta and cereal) are fortified with folic acid.[11] This is a major factor in reducing the number of neural tube defects that occur, but it is still recommended that anyone who is at risk of a deficiency, such as pregnant women, should make sure to get 400 micrograms of folate a day. This is especially the case if the following risk factors are present:Celiac disease or other intestinal absorption disorders
Thalassemia or sickle cell anemia (hereditary red blood cell disorders)
Clinical obesity: high BMI: > 30kg/m2
Family history of, or partner with a family history of, neural tube defects. In this case, folic acid acts as “insurance.”

People with a mild reaction may find that antihistamine medications help to relieve itching. Severe allergic reactions require emergency treatment. These people may be prescribed an EpiPen/Jext which is used to deliver adrenaline in an emergency.,"Getting a definite diagnosis of triggers may help to avoid these and reduce or completely stop symptoms. For some people, it is possible to undergo desensitization therapy, which means the body is slowly exposed to the trigger responsible for their allergy. This causes the immune system to slowly get used to the trigger, helping to reduce the severity of the allergic reaction in the future.",[]

A: It is safe to eat peanuts during pregnancy, so long as you’re not allergic yourself. There is no evidence to suggest that eating peanuts during pregnancy increases the chances of the baby being allergic to peanuts.[11]Q: Can I eat venison (deer meat) during pregnancy?
A: It is safe to eat venison during pregnancy. However, it is important to ensure that the meat has been cooked thoroughly, as raw or undercooked venison is linked with toxoplasmosis. Care should also be taken to ensure proper hygiene while the venison is being prepared.Q: What should I do if I eat something risky?

Foods to Eat During Pregnancy,https://ada.com/foods-to-eat-during-pregnancy/,,[],[],[],[],[],"Q: Is it possible for people who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet to have a healthy pregnancy?
A: Yes. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics pronounces plant-based diets healthy for all stages of a person’s lifestyle, including pregnancy and lactation. Just like non-vegetarians and vegans, people who follow a plant-based diet will need to ensure that their food choices during pregnancy include the right amounts of dairy, protein, starchy foods, fresh fruit and vegetables.It is important that pregnant women ensure that their daily food intake contains adequate levels of vitamins and minerals. People who follow a vegan diet are considered to be more at risk for certain vitamin and mineral deficiencies than the general population, and supplements may be needed to ensure that the correct levels are reached.Consult with a physician in order to choose the best supplements to take during pregnancy, as this varies between people according to factors such as a person’s overall health and the rest of their food intake.The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine provides the following example of a day’s recommended food intake for vegetarian and vegan people during pregnancy:Grains, breads and cereals: Nine or more servings. Examples of single servings include a slice of bread, half a cup of cooked rice or pasta or one cup of ready-to-eat cereal.
Vegetables: Four or more servings, including one dark green vegetable per day.
Fruits: Four or more servings;this may include, cooked, raw, juiced and dried fruit.
Legumes, soy products and non-dairy milks: Five or six servings, which may include fortified soy milk, cooked beans, tofu or tempeh or a meat analogue.
Nuts, seeds, wheat germ: One or two servings, including two tablespoons of nut butter, seeds or wheat germ.Q: Can I diet during pregnancy?
A: According to the National Institute for Healthcare and Excellence (NICE), pregnant women are not advised to diet during pregnancy, and it is recommended that they should talk to their doctor or midwife if they are concerned about their weight.[7]Q: How much weight does a person typically gain during pregnancy?
Guidelines outlined by the US Institute of Medicine state that women of a normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9) usually gain between 11 and 16 kg while pregnant. Women who are overweight (BMI 25-29.9) usually gain between 7 and 11.5 kg, while obese women (BMI 30+) may gain between 5 and 9 kg. Research suggests that women who gain weight within these ranges are less likely to experience complications during and after pregnancy than those who exceed them."
Foreign Body Aspiration,https://ada.com/conditions/foreign-body-aspiration/,,"Symptoms depend on the object inhaled, where it lodges in the airways and the time since the object was inhaled. Typical symptoms include wheezing, choking, difficulty breathing, blueness of the face and a persistent cough. If the object causes a large blockage in the airway, these symptoms occur suddenly and require immediate treatment in an emergency department. If the object has been in the airway for some time, and has caused a lung infection, there may be a fever, a fast pulse, and possibly, collapse.",[],"The diagnosis is made by a doctor assessing symptoms and examining the affected person. X-rays, CT (computer topography) scans of the chest or a bronchoscopy (using a camera to look at the airways) are often needed to confirm the diagnosis.","Treatment involves managing the person's ability to breathe and removing the foreign body. If the person is not able to breathe, airway support and urgent removal is very important. A first step for removing the object is encouraging the affected person to cough. If this is not successful, the object can be removed by a doctor either by bronchoscopy (a camera to look at the airways) or, as a last resort, at surgery. If there is an infection, antibiotics may be given.","Keeping small objects like coins, buttons, button batteries away from small children, teaching them to chew well and advising them not to talk or play while eating can prevent a foreign body ingestion in young kids.",[]
Foreign Body Ingestion,https://ada.com/conditions/foreign-body-ingestion/,,"Typical symptoms are pain in the throat or chest, a lump in the throat or chest, and difficulty swallowing. Other common symptoms might be blood in saliva, refusal to eat, gagging, retching or vomiting. Small children may drool more than normal. If the object begins to cause complications, the affected person may begin to vomit blood, develop abdominal pain, become drowsy or collapse.",[],The diagnosis is usually based on a history of swallowing or having seen someone swallow a non-food object. An X-ray of the chest or abdomen is often necessary to either confirm the diagnosis (especially in small children) and to check the position of the object in the digestive tract.,It is important to get specific advice from a doctor if a non-food item is swallowed. Many objects will pass through the gastrointestinal tract without any assistance. Endoscopic retrieval or surgery may be needed in the case of sharp objects or a risk of bleeding. Button batteries also need urgent removal.,"Keeping small objects like coins, buttons and marbles away from small children can help prevent their being swallowed. Children should be supervised when using devices that contain button batteries. Eating slowly and not talking while chewing can also help prevent accidentally swallowing non-food objects.",[]
Functional Dyspepsia,https://ada.com/conditions/functional-dyspepsia/,,"Indigestion is characterized by a group of symptoms affecting the gastrointestinal tract, including:[4]Pain or discomfort in the chest or upper abdomen, usually after eating, eating too quickly
or eating a heavy meal
Bloating of the stomach
Excessive belching
Heartburn
Feeling full quickly and easily
A feeling of extreme fullness after eating
NauseaSymptoms of indigestion will typically vary in severity from person to person and can often be vague and unpredictable. Individuals may not experience all of the dyspeptic symptoms, though most will experience more than one.[5] The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.","Functional dyspepsia is indigestion with no clear cause (such as an ulcer, gastritis or acid reflux). The gastrointestinal tract of individuals who have been diagnosed with the disorder will appear healthy.Despite this, there are certain triggers which may bring on or worsen the symptoms of the condition. They include:Smoking and alcohol[6]
Obesity
Stress and anxiety
Infection with the germ Helicobacter pylori (not all people with the condition will have Helicobacter pylori in their stomach, and many people with the Helicobacter pylori germ will experience no symptoms)
Impairment of the stomach muscles, leading to slowed emptying of the stomach into the duodenum (first segment of the small intestine)
Roughly one in three people with the disorder also experience irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The cause of IBS, however, is unknown, meaning that the possible link between IBS and indigestion has not yet been properly established","Diagnosing functional dyspepsia involves ruling out other conditions that may be causing
the dyspeptic symptoms. Tests to check for conditions such as stomach ulcers, stomach cancer and gallstones must first return negative before a diagnosis can be given. This will usually involve
undergoing a gastroscopy (endoscopy), a procedure in which a doctor will pass a small
telescopic camera through the mouth and into the gastrointestinal tract for examination.If the digestive system appears normal (free of ulcers, for example), a diagnosis of functional dyspepsia can be given. Blood tests, as well as tests to check for the presence of Helicobacter pylori, may also be useful in diagnosing the disorder.[7]","Functional dyspepsia cannot be fully cured, but its symptoms can be successfully managed through
lifestyle changes, medication, or a combination of the two.Lifestyle changes may include:[8]Reducing, managing or removing any causes of ongoing stress and anxiety
Avoiding food and drinks which make the symptoms worse (caffeinated drinks or fatty food, for example)
Eating small, frequent meals as opposed to fewer, larger meals
Losing weight if overweight
Cutting down or giving up alcohol and tobaccoIf lifestyle changes do not help to improve the symptoms, there are
also a variety of medicines that can be effective in treating the symptoms of the condition:Medication to reduce acid in the stomach: Common medications which work in this way
include antacids, proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprazole)
and histamine blockers (such as ranitidine).
Helicobacter pylori treatment: If a Helicobacter pylori infection is present, treating
this with antibiotics may help to improve the symptoms.
Pain medication: Some medications which are usually used to treat depression or pain
can be used at low doses to treat functional dyspepsia. These can be helpful even for people
who are not depressed.",[],"Q: Can children be affected by functional dyspepsia?
A: Yes, pediatric functional dyspepsia is fairly common. In children, the symptoms are
the same as in adults, and can be treated in a similar way. However, some medications may
be unsuitable for use on children, making it important to discuss treatment methods for
children with a doctor or pharmacist. Around half of all children with functional dyspepsia
will begin to feel better within a few weeks. Some children, however, may have symptoms which
last for a number of months.[9]Q: Can functional dyspepsia be cured?
A: There is no cure for functional dyspepsia. Most people manage their symptoms well
with lifestyle changes and medications. Treating Helicobacter pylori (if present in the
stomach) may significantly reduce the symptoms. The symptoms of the condition can be variable, and may eventually occur much less frequently or go away completely.Q: Are there any further health implications to having functional dyspepsia?
A: Functional dyspepsia is not linked to serious illnesses such as stomach cancer.Q: What is the prognosis for functional dyspepsia?
A: Functional dyspepsia is a persistent condition that is not associated with any serious
complications, such as stomach ulcers or stomach cancer. Most people find their symptoms will come and go over time, depending on factors such as stress, lifestyle changes or other triggers.
Most will also be able to manage their symptoms effectively, and some people may find that
the symptoms eventually go away completely.[10]Q: When should I see a doctor?
A: Individuals experiencing one or more of the symptoms of functional dyspepsia should
see a doctor at their earliest convenience. Based on a physical examination, a doctor will
be able to make a diagnosis and offer treatment options.People belonging to the following groups should pay particular attention to symptoms, which
may be an indication of a more serious condition:[11]People aged over 50
People with a family history of digestive malignancy
People who have previously had gastric surgeryPeople who experience any of the following symptoms should seek medical attention as a matter
of urgency, as they may indicate a more serious condition:Involuntary weight loss
Anemia or iron deficiency
Recurrent vomiting
Jaundice
Blood in the vomit
Stool that is dark, tarry or contains blood
Shortness of breath
Severe pain in the neck, jaw or armsIf any of these occur, it is important to see a doctor as a matter of urgency."
