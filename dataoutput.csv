Achilles Tendonitis,https://ada.com/conditions/achilles-tendonitis/,,"The most common symptom of Achilles tendonitis is pain in the back of the foot and heel. The onset of pain may be sudden or gradual.[2]Symptoms of Achilles tendonitis include:[3][4]Pain at the back of the foot and heel when moving the ankle
Pain when pointing the toes, or pushing off from the toes
Pain which becomes worse after exercising
Stiffness along the back of the foot and heel, especially with the first steps in the morning
Swelling and tenderness in the back of the foot and heel
Thickening of the tendon
Bone spurs in cases of insertional tendonitis (see Insertional Achilles tendonitis, below)",,,,
Acne Vulgaris,https://ada.com/conditions/acne-vulgaris/,,"Typical symptoms of acne include skin pimples, cysts and nodules. The pimples are often on the face, although the shoulders, back, chest and other body parts can also be affected. The skin around and over these pimples is sometimes red and sore. With time, the affected skin may become darker or scarred.Types of pimplesThere are six main types of pimples:[2]Blackheads: Small black or yellowish bumps.
Whiteheads:Small white or yellowish bumps, usually firmer than blackheads.
Papules: Small red bumps that can be sore.
Pustules: Similar to papules but will have a white spot in the center caused by a buildup of pus.
Nodules: Large hard bumps that are typically painful.
Cysts: Large lumps, similar to boils, filled with pus that may be painful. A severe form of acne that may cause scarring.",,,,
Acute Appendicitis,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-appendicitis/,,"The signs and symptoms of appendicitis appear quickly, usually starting with abdominal
(stomach) pain. As acute appendicitis can lead to a burst appendix within 24 to 72 hours,
it is important to seek medical attention as soon as symptoms begin to appear. The most
common initial symptoms include:[2]Pain in the upper abdomen or near the navel, starting dull and becoming sharper as it
moves to the lower right-hand side (this location is most common, but pain can also occur
in other parts of the abdomen)
Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting[3]Other common symptoms include:Fever and chills
Difficulty urinating
Difficulty passing gas
Constipation, diarrhea or alternating periods of both
Swollen belly
Severe crampsSymptoms of a burst appendix include intense abdominal pain in the lower right side that
decreases and becomes generalized abdominal pain, accompanied by a high fever.[4]A person experiencing symptoms of appendicitis should seek medical attention and avoid taking
over-the-counter painkillers or other medications, which could mask the symptoms and make
it more difficult to diagnose. They should also avoid eating or drinking, as well as the
use of home remedies such as heating pads, laxatives or enemas, as these can cause the
appendix to burst. People experiencing possible symptoms of acute appendicitis can also use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.Acute appendicitis symptoms in children and adolescentsChildren are most likely to get appendicitis between the ages of 8 and 16.[5] Young children
with acute appendicitis may have difficulty describing the symptoms they are experiencing,
so it is important that parents are aware of the signs of appendicitis. For example, even
if a child is experiencing localized pain on the right side of their abdomen, they might
identify the pain as affecting their entire stomach, leading parents to think their child
has a different condition.[6]The most common symptoms of acute appendicitis in children are:Abdominal pain and pain with movement
Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting
FeverIn older children and teenagers, the most common symptoms are similar to those experienced
by adults.It is not uncommon for acute appendicitis in children to be confused with stomach flu, a
misdiagnosis which increases the risk of a burst appendix.Acute appendicitis symptoms in pregnancyIdentifying appendicitis in pregnant women can be difficult, as many of the symptoms are
similar to the discomfort normally associated with pregnancy, such as nausea, vomiting and
cramping. The appendix may also be pushed by the uterus into the upper abdomen by a few
centimeters, particularly during the third trimester. In this case, pain from appendicitis
may occur in the upper right side, instead of only its usual position in the
lower right side.Women in the later stages of pregnancy are difficult to diagnose with appendicitis because
they tend to have unusual symptoms. These can include a sudden change in bowel habits
(constipation and diarrhea), an increase in gas, and new or worsening heartburn.[7] Pregnancy women experiencing possible symptoms of acute appendicitis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",,,,
Acute Aspiration of Oropharyngeal or Gastric Contents,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-aspiration-of-oropharyngeal-or-gastric-contents/,,"Symptoms may include a cough with eating, choking, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing, extreme tiredness, fever, and a blue tinge to the lips, fingers and feet.",,,,
Acute Bronchitis,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-bronchitis/,,"The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is a cough, which is typically described as dry and hacking in nature in its initial stages. As the condition develops and mucus is built up in the lungs, coughing up mucus will likely occur. This mucus may be yellow, green or clear in colour. The cough generally lasts for around two to three weeks, but can last for longer.[3]Other symptoms of acute bronchitis include:[4]Sore throat
Fever
Chest congestion
Shortness of breath
Wheezing
Chills
FatigueWhen experiencing a very high fever, persistent chills, shoulder and neck pain or if symptoms generally worsen, it is important to seek medical attention. In some cases, acute bronchitis may develop into pneumonia, a more serious condition.[5]",,,,
Acute Gastritis,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-gastritis/,,"Symptoms of acute gastritis can include recurring nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, a feeling of burning in the stomach and passing melena, a stool containing blood related to upper gastrointestinal bleeding; this will appear to be black and tarry.[6]Some people also experience a feeling of fullness in the upper part of the stomach or abdomen, become full too quickly after eating, or vomit blood, which may resemble coffee grounds.

Acute Heart Failure,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-heart-failure/,,"Symptoms of acute heart failure can appear very quickly. It can be indicated by the appearance of new symptoms, or by an existing heart condition suddenly becoming worse.General symptoms of acute heart failure include:[5][6][7]Shortness of breath while moving or lying flat, also known as dyspnea
Feeling tired
Cough that may be worse at night or when lying down
Swelling of feet, ankles, legs, abdomen or veins in the neck
Cool peripheries, such as hands and feet, due to reduced cardiac output
Veins in the neck protrudingSwelling, also known as edema, is caused by fluid building up in different parts of the body because the heart is no longer able to pump efficiently. This is known as congestive heart failure. Depending on the location in the body of the fluid buildup or congestion, this can cause other symptoms. For example:[7]Congestion in the kidneys can mean less urine being produced during the day, which leads to frequent urination during the night
Congestion in the bowel can lead to nausea and vomitingLess common symptoms of acute heart failureNot everyone will experience the following symptoms of acute heart failure. Some of these symptoms are caused by an underlying condition. Less common symptoms of acute heart failure include:Palpitations, the feeling that the heart has skipped or added a beat, where the person has arrhythmia
Fever, which can be caused by underlying infection
Fainting, also called syncope
Blue/colored lips, skin or tongue, also called central cyanosisComplications of acute heart failureAcute heart failure can cause other conditions, often as a consequence of fluid building up in different parts of the body.Pulmonary edemaIf fluid builds up in the lungs, this causes a very serious condition called pulmonary edema. Fluid is pushed into air sacs which reduces the lungs’ ability to transfer oxygen into the blood. This leads to shortness of breath, particularly when lying down. Other symptoms can include:[8][9]Coughing or, in some cases, coughing up blood
Wheezing
Sluggishness
Anxiety
Swelling in the legs or abdomenPulmonary edema can be life-threatening. Anyone showing signs of pulmonary edema should see a doctor immediately.AscitesAcute heart failure can cause a buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity. This is called ascites and can cause pain in the abdomen, bloating and shortness of breath.[10]Cardiorenal syndromeAround one in four people who have acute heart failure also experience a significant worsening of kidney function, known as cardiorenal syndrome. The older a person is, the higher their risk of developing cardiorenal syndrome. The risk is increased if the person also has:[7][11]Hypertension
Diabetes
A history of heart and/or renal failure
AtherosclerosisCardiohepatic syndromeAcute heart failure can lead to a worsening of liver function. Liver cells can be destroyed through pressure building up due to blood slowing down before entering the heart, which is a very serious condition. It can cause:Jaundice, which is when skin and whites of eyes look yellow, urine becomes darker and stools become paler
Nausea
Vomiting
Abdominal painAnother potential complication is cholestasis, where bile flow reduces or stops. This can cause jaundice, itchy skin, dark urine and bad smelling stools.[7][12][13][14]",,,,
Acute Laryngitis,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-laryngitis/,,"Typical symptoms of laryngitis include:Dysphonia (hoarseness of the voice)
Fever (during the first few days of infection)
Sore throat
A need to clear the throat frequently
A coughSymptoms usually appear suddenly and worsen after around three days.[1] After around three weeks, with appropriate treatment including drinking plenty of water and resting the larynx, symptoms such as a cough and hoarse voice usually relieve.Even though acute laryngitis usually relives without the need for medical attention, it is important for an affected person to see a doctor promptly if they:Experience swallowing problems (dysphagia)
Cough up blood
Have trouble breathing
Have a persistent fever, with a temperature of higher than 103 F (39.4 C)
Have respiratory problems (breathing difficulties)These symptoms may indicate epiglottis, a condition in which the tissue that covers the lid of the windpipe becomes inflamed. Epiglottis can be life-threatening for both children and adults.[2]In children, the symptoms of laryngitis are the same as those in adults. When children under five are affected, the condition is called croup. Croup usually clears up in 5-7 days, and medical attention should be sought if their symptoms of infection do not improve during this timeframe. Antibiotics are not used to treat croup, because it is caused by a viral infection.[3]People experiencing possible symptoms of acute laryngitis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",,,,
Acute Otitis Media,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-otitis-media/,,"Typical symptoms of a middle ear infection are pain in the ear and difficulty hearing with the affected ear.

Acute Panic Attack,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-panic-attack/,,"People who experience a panic attack are not usually aware that the episode is going to occur until it begins, particularly if the affected individual has not experienced a panic attack before.Symptoms before onsetPhysiological changes in the body – such as an increasing heart rate – have been found to occur up to an hour in advance of a panic attack, but the first perceptible signs generally only become apparent as the attack begins. These include symptoms of mental distress, such as the belief that one is dying, and concurrent physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate (palpitations), sweating and trembling.There are typically no perceptible signs of the onset of a panic attack. However, research has been conducted to test the hypothesis that panic attacks occur spontaneously. Findings suggest that imperceptible changes in the body can begin before the actual panic attack begins.Physiological changes, which may take place up to an hour in advance of a panic attack, include:[2]Irregular breathing patterns
Increased heart rateHowever, these physiological indicators are subtle, unlike the symptoms that are present during a panic attack itself. In general, they go unnoticed by the affected individual and those around them and do not serve as an advance indicator of the panic attack they precede.Symptoms during a panic attackAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), four or more of the following physical and psychological symptoms must be present:[3]Palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate
Sweating
Trembling or shaking
Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering
Feeling of choking
Chest pain or discomfort
Nausea or abdominal distress
Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint
Chills or heat sensations
Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations)
Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself)
Fear of losing control or going crazy
Fear of dyingIf four or more of the above symptoms are present, it is known as a full-symptom panic attack. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.Limited-symptom panic attacksIt is possible to experience a panic attack, in which less than four of the above symptoms are present. This is called a limited-symptom panic attack.Limited-symptom panic attacks are often experienced by people undergoing effective treatment for panic disorder, as they learn to use therapeutic techniques to reduce the number and severity of the symptoms they experience during an attack.DurationThe duration of a panic attack is usually between 5 and 20 minutes, with most panic attacks reaching their peak at around 10 minutes.Nearly all panic attacks subside in under an hour, at which point the physical and psychological symptoms will be alleviating or no longer be present. It is normal to feel exhausted and shaken by the experience of having a panic attack after the attack itself is over, and there are many techniques, such as breathing exercises, which can help one begin to feel better.Recurrent panic attacksIt is possible for a person to become so distressed by a panic attack that, rather than calming down afterwards, they experience a recurrent panic attack or several. One should not be concerned about one’s long-term health if one experiences one or more subsequent attacks after the initial episode, as there are no long-term health consequences.Learning coping techniques, such as breathing exercises to perform in the event of a panic attack, can help one calm down efficiently, reducing the likelihood of recurrent panic attacks.Nocturnal panic attackIt is possible to experience a panic attack in one’s sleep. This is called a nocturnal panic attack and involves waking up in a state of panic.[4] Nocturnal panic attacks are no different from panic attacks that occur when one is awake, in terms of their symptoms, duration and possible triggers.Nocturnal panic attacks are a common occurrence in people with panic disorder, but can also be one’s first or only experience of a panic attack.Panic attack or heart attack?The symptoms of a panic attack can be similar to those of a heart attack. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works.It is common for people experiencing a panic attack to become convinced that they are having a heart attack during the episode. Although this may be related to the distressing thoughts that accompany a panic attack, emergency medical services should be called if a heart attack is suspected, as – unlike a panic attack – a heart attack requires prompt medical attention and can be life-threatening.Key differences between a heart attack and a panic attack include:[5]Tingling: In a heart attack, a person may experience a tingling sensation in their left arm, whereas in a panic attack the tingling sensation, if present, will affect the entire body.
Breathing: A panic attack often causes hyperventilation (breathing too quickly) but a heart attack does not. However, both panic and heart attacks can cause the sensation of shortness of breath.
Vomiting: It is common to vomit during a heart attack, but less common to do so during a panic attack.
Pain in a panic attack: The sensation will be sharp, will feel worse when one breathes deeply or puts pressure on the chest and will usually be felt all over the heart. It will disappear within five to ten minutes.
Pain in a heart attack: The sensation will be like a crushing feeling all over the chest and may extend into the shoulders, left arm, neck and back. It will last longer than ten minutes and will not be made worse by breathing or pressing on the chest.Despite being able to identify these differences, it is advisable to always seek medical attention if the affected person:[6]Has a history of heart attacks
Meets the risk criteria for a heart attack, such as high blood pressure, being overweight, getting limited physical exercise
Has never had a panic attack beforeIf one is not deemed to be at risk of a heart attack, psychotherapeutic techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be recommended in order to help the affected person overcome any long-term anxiety about having a heart attack. This will help prevent a fear of having a heart attack from manifesting in, or forming the basis of, future panic attacks.",,,,
Acute Pharyngitis,https://ada.com/conditions/acute-pharyngitis/,,"A variety of symptoms are associated with pharyngitis, with some of the most common including:[2]Sore throat
Pain or difficulty when swallowing or talking
Swollen, sore glands in the neck or throat
Red throat and red, swollen tonsils
A hoarse voice
White or grey patches on the back of the throatA sore throat is the characteristic symptom of pharyngitis and – in some cases – may be the only symptom. A cobblestone appearance at the back of the throat, colloquially known as “cobblestone throat”, is in some cases present. This is a distinctive lumpy, irritated appearance of the back of the throat, caused by enlarged lymphatic tissue. It is visible on visual inspection. It can also be caused by a post-nasal drip, in which mucus that accumulates in the back of the nose and throat drips downward from the back of the nose.Commonly, pharyngitis is caused by an underlying condition such as a common cold or flu.
